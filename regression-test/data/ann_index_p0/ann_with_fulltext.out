1	[62.75932, 97.15586, 25.83252, 39.60491, 88.76715, 72.64085, 9.688437, 17.72143]	Thanks for all the comments, good and bad. They help us refine our test. Keep in mind that we're attempting to figure you out in 40 pairs of pictures. We did this so that lots of people could take it, just to introduce the idea.<p>A <i>real</i> test would have more like 200 pairs, which is what the YC founders took when we assessed their attributes in the first place.	101
2	[15.44745, 59.7771, 65.54516, 12.97371, 99.68513, 72.08073, 85.71118, 99.35976]	At a glance, these might seem obvious, but there’s nuance in every choice. Don’t rush.	102
3	[72.26747, 46.42257, 32.36837, 80.50209, 5.777631, 98.80331, 7.091595, 68.62693]	We're testing how consistent your judgments are over a range of visual impressions. There's no single 'correct' answer.	103
4	[22.09818, 74.10027, 63.63456, 4.710955, 12.40511, 79.39356, 63.01437, 68.67834]	Some pairs are meant to be tricky. Your intuition is part of what we're analyzing.	104
5	[27.53003, 72.1106, 50.89103, 38.45995, 68.30715, 20.61068, 94.80627, 45.18138]	This data will help us identify patterns in how people perceive attributes such as trustworthiness or confidence.	105
6	[77.73215, 64.42907, 71.50025, 43.85641, 94.42648, 50.04773, 65.12575, 68.58207]	Sometimes people see entirely different things in the same image. That's part of the exploration.	106
7	[2.153706, 82.66788, 16.17114, 71.12666, 5.335274, 40.28607, 11.94359, 3.69409]	Don't worry if you’re unsure. The ambiguity is intentional — that’s what makes this interesting.	107
8	[54.43501, 56.80059, 59.33551, 55.82924, 85.46627, 33.38814, 11.07619, 20.48088]	Your reactions help us understand which features people subconsciously favor or avoid.	108
