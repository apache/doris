2	At a glance, these might seem obvious, but there’s nuance in every choice. Don’t rush.
3	We're testing how consistent your judgments are over a range of visual impressions. There's no single 'correct' answer.
4	Some pairs are meant to be tricky. Your intuition is part of what we're analyzing.
5	This data will help us identify patterns in how people perceive attributes such as trustworthiness or confidence.
6	Sometimes people see entirely different things in the same image. That's part of the exploration.
7	Don't worry if you’re unsure. The ambiguity is intentional — that’s what makes this interesting.
8	Your reactions help us understand which features people subconsciously favor or avoid.
