Apache Doris is an easy-to-use, high-performance and real-time analytical database based on MPP architecture, known for its extreme speed and ease of use. It only requires a sub-second response time to return query results under massive data and can support not only high-concurrent point query scenarios but also high-throughput complex analysis scenarios.

Based on this, Apache Doris can better meet the scenarios of report analysis, ad-hoc query, unified data warehouse, Data Lake Query Acceleration, etc. Users can build user behavior analysis, AB test platform, log retrieval analysis, user portrait analysis, order analysis, and other applications on top of this.

**Technical Overview**: ðŸ”—[Introduction to Apache Doris](https://doris.apache.org/docs/summary/basic-summary)

## Core Features

- **Easy to Use:** Two processes, no other dependencies; online cluster scaling, automatic replica recovery; compatible with MySQL protocol, and using standard SQL.

- **High Performance:** Extremely fast performance for low-latency and high-throughput queries with columnar storage engine, modern MPP architecture, vectorized query engine, pre-aggregated materialized view and data index.

- **Single Unified:** A single system can support real-time data serving, interactive data analysis and offline data processing scenarios.

- **Federated Querying:** Supports federated querying of data lakes such as Hive, Iceberg, Hudi, and databases such as MySQL and Elasticsearch.

- **Various Data Import Methods:** Supports batch import from HDFS/S3 and stream import from MySQL Binlog/Kafka; supports micro-batch writing through HTTP interface and real-time writing using Insert in JDBC.

- **Rich Ecology:** Spark uses Spark Doris Connector to read and write Doris; Flink Doris Connector enables Flink CDC to implement exactly-once data writing to Doris; DBT Doris Adapter is provided to transform data in Doris with DBT.
