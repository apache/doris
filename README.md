## Overall Architecture

Apache Doris uses the MySQL protocol, is highly compatible with MySQL syntax, and supports standard SQL. Users can access Apache Doris through various client tools, and it seamlessly integrates with BI tools.

### Storage-Compute Integrated Architecture

The storage-compute integrated architecture of Apache Doris is streamlined and easy to maintain. As shown in the figure below, it consists of only two types of processes:

- **Frontend (FE):** Primarily responsible for handling user requests, query parsing and planning, metadata management, and node management tasks.

- **Backend (BE):** Primarily responsible for data storage and query execution. Data is partitioned into shards and stored with multiple replicas across BE nodes.

![The overall architecture of Apache Doris](https://cdn.selectdb.com/static/What_is_Apache_Doris_adb26397e2.png)

<br />

In a production environment, multiple FE nodes can be deployed for disaster recovery. Each FE node maintains a full copy of the metadata. The FE nodes are divided into three roles:

| Role      | Function                                                     |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Master    | The FE Master node is responsible for metadata read and write operations. When metadata changes occur in the Master, they are synchronized to Follower or Observer nodes via the BDB JE protocol. |
| Follower  | The Follower node is responsible for reading metadata. If the Master node fails, a Follower node can be selected as the new Master. |
| Observer  | The Observer node is responsible for reading metadata and is mainly used to increase query concurrency. It does not participate in cluster leadership elections. |

Both FE and BE processes are horizontally scalable, enabling a single cluster to support hundreds of machines and tens of petabytes of storage capacity. The FE and BE processes use a consistency protocol to ensure high availability of services and high reliability of data. The storage-compute integrated architecture is highly integrated, significantly reducing the operational complexity of distributed systems.


## Core Features of Apache Doris

- **High Availability**: In Apache Doris, both metadata and data are stored with multiple replicas, synchronizing data logs via the quorum protocol. Data write is considered successful once a majority of replicas have completed the write, ensuring that the cluster remains available even if a few nodes fail. Apache Doris supports both same-city and cross-region disaster recovery, enabling dual-cluster master-slave modes. When some nodes experience failures, the cluster can automatically isolate the faulty nodes, preventing the overall cluster availability from being affected.

- **High Compatibility**: Apache Doris is highly compatible with the MySQL protocol and supports standard SQL syntax, covering most MySQL and Hive functions. This high compatibility allows users to seamlessly migrate and integrate existing applications and tools. Apache Doris supports the MySQL ecosystem, enabling users to connect Doris using MySQL Client tools for more convenient operations and maintenance. It also supports MySQL protocol compatibility for BI reporting tools and data transmission tools, ensuring efficiency and stability in data analysis and data transmission processes.

- **Real-Time Data Warehouse**: Based on Apache Doris, a real-time data warehouse service can be built. Apache Doris offers second-level data ingestion capabilities, capturing incremental changes from upstream online transactional databases into Doris within seconds. Leveraging vectorized engines, MPP architecture, and Pipeline execution engines, Doris provides sub-second data query capabilities, thereby constructing a high-performance, low-latency real-time data warehouse platform.

- **Unified Lakehouse**: Apache Doris can build a unified lakehouse architecture based on external data sources such as data lakes or relational databases. The Doris unified lakehouse solution enables seamless integration and free data flow between data lakes and data warehouses, helping users directly utilize data warehouse capabilities to solve data analysis problems in data lakes while fully leveraging data lake data management capabilities to enhance data value.

- **Flexible Modeling**: Apache Doris offers various modeling approaches, such as wide table models, pre-aggregation models, star/snowflake schemas, etc. During data import, data can be flattened into wide tables and written into Doris through compute engines like Flink or Spark, or data can be directly imported into Doris, performing data modeling operations through views, materialized views, or real-time multi-table joins.

## Technical overview

Doris provides an efficient SQL interface and is fully compatible with the MySQL protocol. Its query engine is based on an MPP (Massively Parallel Processing) architecture, capable of efficiently executing complex analytical queries and achieving low-latency real-time queries. Through columnar storage technology for data encoding and compression, it significantly optimizes query performance and storage compression ratio.

### Interface

Apache Doris adopts the MySQL protocol, supports standard SQL, and is highly compatible with MySQL syntax. Users can access Apache Doris through various client tools and seamlessly integrate it with BI tools, including but not limited to Smartbi, DataEase, FineBI, Tableau, Power BI, and Apache Superset. Apache Doris can work as the data source for any BI tools that support the MySQL protocol.

### Storage engine

Apache Doris has a columnar storage engine, which encodes, compresses, and reads data by column. This enables a very high data compression ratio and largely reduces unnecessary data scanning, thus making more efficient use of IO and CPU resources.

Apache Doris supports various index structures to minimize data scans:

- **Sorted Compound Key Index**: Users can specify three columns at most to form a compound sort key. This can effectively prune data to better support highly concurrent reporting scenarios.

- **Min/Max Index**: This enables effective data filtering in equivalence and range queries of numeric types.

- **BloomFilter Index**: This is very effective in equivalence filtering and pruning of high-cardinality columns.

- **Inverted Index**: This enables fast searching for any field.

Apache Doris supports a variety of data models and has optimized them for different scenarios:

- **Detail Model (Duplicate Key Model):** A detail data model designed to meet the detailed storage requirements of fact tables.

- **Primary Key Model (Unique Key Model):** Ensures unique keys; data with the same key is overwritten, enabling row-level data updates.

- **Aggregate Model (Aggregate Key Model):** Merges value columns with the same key, significantly improving performance through pre-aggregation.

Apache Doris also supports strongly consistent single-table materialized views and asynchronously refreshed multi-table materialized views. Single-table materialized views are automatically refreshed and maintained by the system, requiring no manual intervention from users. Multi-table materialized views can be refreshed periodically using in-cluster scheduling or external scheduling tools, reducing the complexity of data modeling.

### 🔍 Query Engine

Apache Doris has an MPP-based query engine for parallel execution between and within nodes. It supports distributed shuffle join for large tables to better handle complicated queries.

<br />

![Query Engine](https://cdn.selectdb.com/static/What_is_Apache_Doris_1_c6f5ba2af9.png)

<br />

The query engine of Apache Doris is fully vectorized, with all memory structures laid out in a columnar format. This can largely reduce virtual function calls, increase cache hit rates, and make efficient use of SIMD instructions. Apache Doris delivers a 5~10 times higher performance in wide table aggregation scenarios than non-vectorized engines.

<br />

![Doris query engine](https://cdn.selectdb.com/static/What_is_Apache_Doris_2_29cf58cc6b.png)

<br />

Apache Doris uses adaptive query execution technology to dynamically adjust the execution plan based on runtime statistics. For example, it can generate a runtime filter and push it to the probe side. Specifically, it pushes the filters to the lowest-level scan node on the probe side, which largely reduces the data amount to be processed and increases join performance. The runtime filter of Apache Doris supports In/Min/Max/Bloom Filter.

Apache Doris uses a Pipeline execution engine that breaks down queries into multiple sub-tasks for parallel execution, fully leveraging multi-core CPU capabilities. It simultaneously addresses the thread explosion problem by limiting the number of query threads. The Pipeline execution engine reduces data copying and sharing, optimizes sorting and aggregation operations, thereby significantly improving query efficiency and throughput.

In terms of the optimizer, Apache Doris employs a combined optimization strategy of CBO (Cost-Based Optimizer), RBO (Rule-Based Optimizer), and HBO (History-Based Optimizer). RBO supports constant folding, subquery rewriting, predicate pushdown, and more. CBO supports join reordering and other optimizations. HBO recommends the optimal execution plan based on historical query information. These multiple optimization measures ensure that Doris can enumerate high-performance query plans across various types of queries.
