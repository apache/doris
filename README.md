Doris is an MPP-based interactive SQL data warehousing for reporting and analysis.
Its original name was Palo, developed in Baidu. After donated to Apache Software Foundation, it was renamed Doris.

- Doris provides high concurrent low latency point query performance, as well as high throughput queries of ad-hoc analysis.

- Doris provides batch data loading and real-time mini-batch data loading.

- Doris provides high availability, reliability, fault tolerance, and scalability.

The main advantages of Doris are the simplicity (of developing, deploying and using) and meeting many data serving requirements in a single system. For details, refer to [Overview](https://github.com/apache/incubator-doris/wiki/Doris-Overview).
