## Doris Develop Environment based on docker

### Preparation

1. Download the Doris code repo

    ```console
    $ cd /to/your/workspace/
    $ git clone https://github.com/apache/incubator-doris.git
    ```

    You can remove the `.git` dir in `incubator-doris/` to make the dir size smaller.
    So that the following generated docker image can be smaller.

2. Copy Dockerfile

    ```console
    $ cd /to/your/workspace/
    $ cp incubator-doris/docker/Dockerfile ./
    ```

After preparation, your workspace should like this:

```
.
├── Dockerfile
├── incubator-doris
│   ├── be
│   ├── bin
│   ├── build.sh
│   ├── conf
│   ├── DISCLAIMER-WIP
│   ├── docker
│   ├── docs
│   ├── env.sh
│   ├── fe
│   ├── ...
```

### Build docker image

```console
$ cd /to/your/workspace/
$ docker build -t doris:v1.0  .
```

> `doris` is docker image repository name and `v1.0` is tag name, you can change them to whatever you like.

### Use docker image

This docker image you just built does not contain Doris source code repo. You need
to download it first and map it to the container. (You can just use the one you
used to build this image before)

```console
$ docker run -it -v /your/local/path/incubator-doris/:/root/incubator-doris/ doris:v1.0
$ $ docker run -it -v /your/local/.m2:/root/.m2 -v /your/local/incubator-doris-DORIS-x.x.x-release/:/root/incubator-doris-DORIS-x.x.x-release/ doris:v1.0
```

Then you can build source code inside the container.

```console
$ cd /root/incubator-doris/
$ sh build.sh
```

**NOTICE**

The default JDK version is openjdk 11, if you want to use openjdk 8, you can run the command:

```console
$ alternatives --set java java-1.8.0-openjdk.x86_64
$ alternatives --set javac java-1.8.0-openjdk.x86_64
$ export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0
```

The version of jdk you used to run FE must be the same version you used to compile FE.
