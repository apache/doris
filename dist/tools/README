The `parse_licenses.py` script is mainly used to prepare license files
related to third-party dependencies when doing binary release.

The list of licenses is generated by the following steps:

1.

After compiling the FE and Broker modules, the `THIRD-PARTY.txt` file is generated in the `target/classes`
directory of each module, which you can find with the following command:

`find target/classes -name THIRD-PARTY.txt`

2.

Combine the contents of these files into one file, e.g.

`cat THIRD-PARTY.txt >> THIRD-PARTY-all.txt`

3.

Generate a collated list of third-party dependent licenses with the following command.

`python parse_licenses.py THIRD-PARTY-all.txt result.txt`

The script will parse the `THIRD-PARTY-all.txt` file and sort the output by license type.

> Note that the final output is still subject to manual finishing.
> You can refer to `dist/LICENSE-dist.txt`.
