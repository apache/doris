 * 1. ANY: match any operator
 * 2. MULTI: match multiple operators
 * 3. FIXED: the leaf node of pattern tree, which can be matched by a single operator
 *         but this operator cannot be used in rules
 * 4. MULTI_FIXED: the leaf node of pattern tree, which can be matched by multiple operators,
 *        but these operators cannot be used in rules
