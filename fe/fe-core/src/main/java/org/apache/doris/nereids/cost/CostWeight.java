 * cost weight.
 * The intuition behind `HEAVY_OPERATOR_PUNISH_FACTOR` is we need to avoid this form of join patterns:
 * Plan1: L join ( AGG1(A) join AGG2(B))
 * But
 * Plan2: L join AGG1(A) join AGG2(B) is welcomed.
 * AGG is time-consuming operator. From the perspective of rowCount, nereids may choose Plan1,
 * because `Agg1 join Agg2` generates few tuples. But in Plan1, Agg1 and Agg2 are done in serial, in Plan2, Agg1 and
 * Agg2 are done in parallel. And hence, Plan1 should be punished.
 * <p>
 * An example is tpch q15.
