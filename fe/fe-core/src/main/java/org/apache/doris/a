Emphasize disk usage for calculating load score.

thisBeCapacityCoefficient:
  If this be has a high used capacity percent, we should increase its load score.
  So we increase capacity coefficient with this be's used capacity percent.

Also we emphasize the difference of disk usage between all the BEs.
For example, if the tablets have a big difference in data size.
Then for below two BEs, their load score maybe the same:
BE A:  disk usage = 60%,  replica number = 2000  (it contains the big tablets)
BE B:  disk usage = 30%,  replica number = 4000  (it contains the small tablets)

But what we want is: firstly move some big tablets from A to B, after their disk usages are close,
then move some small tablets from B to A, finally both of their disk usages and replica number
are close.

allBeCapacityCoefficient is used to achieve this, when the max difference between all BE's
disk usages >= 30%,  we set the capacity cofficient to 1.0 and avoid the affect of replica num.
After the disk usage difference decrease, then decrease the capacity cofficient.
