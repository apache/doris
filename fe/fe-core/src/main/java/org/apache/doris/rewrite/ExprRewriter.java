/**
 * Helper class that drives the transformation of Exprs according to a given list of
 * ExprRewriteRules. The rules are applied as follows:
 * - a single rule is applied repeatedly to the Expr and all its children in a bottom-up
 *   fashion until there are no more changes
 * - the rule list is applied repeatedly until no rule has made any changes
 * - the rules are applied in the order they appear in the rule list
 * Keeps track of how many transformations were applied.
 *
 * There are two types of Rewriter, the first is Repeat Rewriter,
 * and the other is Once Rewriter.
 * The Repeat Rewriter framework will call Rule repeatedly
 * until the entire expression does not change.
 * The Once Rewriter framework will only call Rule once.
 * According to different Rule strategies,
 * Doris match different Rewriter framework execution.
