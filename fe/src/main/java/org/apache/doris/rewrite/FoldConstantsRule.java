/**
 * This rule replaces a constant Expr with its equivalent LiteralExpr by evaluating the
 * Expr in the BE. Exprs that are already LiteralExprs are not changed.
 *
 * TODO: Expressions fed into this rule are currently not required to be analyzed
 * in order to support constant folding in expressions that contain unresolved
 * references to select-list aliases (such expressions cannot be analyzed).
 * The cross-dependencies between rule transformations and analysis are vague at the
 * moment and make rule application overly complicated.
 *
 * Examples:
 * 1 + 1 + 1 --> 3
 * toupper('abc') --> 'ABC'
 * cast('2016-11-09' as timestamp) --> TIMESTAMP '2016-11-09 00:00:00'
