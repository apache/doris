/**
 * Base class for all Expr equal rules. A rule is free to modify Exprs in place,
 * but must return a different Expr object if any modifications were made.
 * An ExprRewriteRule is intended to apply its transformation on a single Expr and not
 * recursively on all its children. The recursive and repeated application of
 * ExprRewriteRules is driven by an ExprRewriter.
 * An ExprRewriteRule should preserve the type of the transformed expression to avoid
 * having to re-analyze its parent (if any). This behavior guarantees that the Expr
 * tree remains valid even if arbitrary subexpressions are transformed. It also means
 * that the transformed expression may have a wider type than necessary. Callers are
 * free to reset() and analyze() the result if they desire the minimal type.
