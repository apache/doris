# This file records the version info of thirdparty,
# the format is white space separated, and defined as following:
#
# ${verison_num} ${date} ${dep1} ${dep2} ${dep3} ...
# 
# e.g.
# 1 20220917 lz4 curl tcmalloc
#
# where
# ${version_num} is a monotonic consecutive integer indicates how many
# times the third-party is upgraded.
# ${depx} is the dependency updated, if you want a full rebuild when
# updating third-party, specify no ${depx}, say,
#
# ${version_num} ${date}
# 
# e.g.
# 1 20220917
#
# Once all third-parties are installed, build-thirdparty.sh will copy
# version.txt to "installed" folder, and it will check version.txt for
# incremental or full build automatically.
#
# **Note that no empty lines are allowed in this file.**
