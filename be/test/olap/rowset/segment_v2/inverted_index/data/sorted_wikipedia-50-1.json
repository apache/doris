A second decree the same day transferred executive power in Prussia to the Reich Minister of the Armed Forces [[Kurt von Schleicher]] and restricted fundamental rights.\n\nPapen had two rationales for the coup. One was that the [[1932 Prussian state election]] had left a divided parliament with no viable possibilities for a coalition. This led to a caretaker government under the coalition that had held power before the election, with no clear path to replacing it with a new governing coalition. The second and major rationale was that in parts of Prussia there were violent street demonstrations and clashes taking place that Papen said the caretaker government could not control.\n\nThe coup had the effect of weakening the federalist [[Weimar Constitution|Constitution]] of the [[Weimar Republic]] and facilitating the centralization of the Reich under [[Adolf Hitler]] after he was [[Chancellor of Germany#Nazi Germany (1933–1945)|appointed chancellor in January 1933]]. The immediate result, however, was elimination of the last resistance in Prussia to Papen's attempt to establish a ‘New State’, essentially a precursor to a restored monarchy. Contrary to Papen's intent, the move ultimately had the effect of easing Hitler's path to power.\n\n== Historical context ==\n\n=== Discussions about a reorganization of the Reich ===\nSince the late 1920s the relationship between the Reich and [[Free State of Prussia|Prussia]] had been the subject of discussion by the League for the Renewal of the Reich ({{Lang|de|Bund zur Erneuerung des Reiches}}), a group to which [[Franz von Papen|von Papen]] belonged. The aim of the circle, often called the Luther League after its founder [[Hans Luther]], a former Reich chancellor and president of the [[Reichsbank]] (1930–1933), was to strengthen the Reich's central power, reorganize northern Germany, especially Prussia, which was by far the largest state in Germany, and create an authoritarian presidential regime. The program included having the Reich president, the Reich government and the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] replace the Prussian government and parliament, and empowering the chancellor to appoint provincial commissioners. It was assumed that Prussia, contrary to the interest of the entire nation, was as a state pursuing hegemony within the existing national structure. A comprehensive segmentation and disempowerment was proposed.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Bund zur Erneuerung des Reiches, Leitsätze |trans-title=League for the Renewal of the Reich, Guiding Principles |url=https://www.historisches-lexikon-bayerns.de/images/8/80/Artikel_44406_bilder_value_1_bund-zur-erneuerung.pdf |access-date=25 March 2016 |website=Historisches Lexikon Bayerns |language=de}}</ref>\n\nIn 1928 a conference of the states, consisting of members of the Reich cabinet and all of the state minister presidents, came to the joint resolution that the relationship between the Reich and the states in the Republic was unsatisfactory and in need of fundamental reform, and that a \"strong Reich power\" was necessary.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |last=Holtmann |first=Everhard |date= |title=Die Weimarer Republik.

Papen.jpg|thumb|Franz von Papen]]\nPapen's initiative for the Prussian coup is to be understood within the context of the plan for the establishment of a ‘New State’, a concept propagated above all by Walther Schotte – a journalist and historian who provided Papen with ideas and theories&nbsp;– and [[Edgar Jung]], a lawyer and anti-democratic journalist. They did not favor the [[Nazism|National Socialists]] but rather wanted to create the precursor to a monarchy, an authoritarian presidential regime with a chancellor dependent on the confidence of the president and a parliament severely limited in its rights, similar to the government under the [[constitution of the German Empire]]. Papen's long-term goal was to restore the [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]] monarchy. The ‘New State’ was to stand above particularist interests and provide the necessary security, order, and tranquility for economic development.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Scholl |first=Stefan |title=Begrenzte Abhängigkeit. \"Wirtschaft\" und \"Politik\" im 20.

In the [[1932 Prussian state election]] of 24 April, the [[Nazi Party|Nazi Party (NSDAP)]] won 162 seats and the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party of Germany (KPD)]] 57, a total of 219 out of 423, or 52%. All other parties together won only 204 seats, or 48%. The NSDAP and KPD would not work together, and none of the other parties could form a government with a parliamentary majority without the support of one of the anti-democratic parties, something that none of them was willing to accept.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Der \"Preußenschlag\" |url=https://weimar.bundesarchiv.de/WEIMAR/DE/Content/Dokumente-zur-Zeitgeschichte/1932-07-20_preussenschlag.html |access-date=17 May 2023 |website=bundesarchiv.de}}</ref> That meant that after the formal resignation of the previous state government – the third cabinet of [[Otto Braun]]&nbsp;– it remained in office on a caretaker basis in accordance with Article 59 of the state constitution.<ref>{{Cite wikisource|title=Constitution of the Free State of Prussia}}</ref> With parliamentary rules having recently been changed to require an absolute majority for the election of a minister president, it was possible that the caretaker government could continue on indefinitely.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Winkler |first=Heinrich August |title=Weimar 1918–1933 |publisher=C. H. Beck |year=1993 |isbn=9783406438844 |location=Munich |pages=457–461 |language=de}}</ref> The situation was similar to that in Bavaria, [[Free State of Saxony|Saxony]], [[People's State of Hesse|Hesse]], [[Free People's State of Württemberg|Württemberg]] and [[Hamburg]], although the Reich government did not concern itself with them.\n\n== Papen's and Hindenburg's approach ==\nA center-right government in Prussia consisting of the NSDAP (162 seats) and the Centre Party (67 seats) with a 53% majority was technically possible. Together with the 31 seats of the nationalist-conservative [[German National People's Party]] (DNVP), the coalition would have had as many as 260 of 423 seats. Reich Chancellor von Papen sought such a coalition, but the NSDAP claimed power for itself alone. On 7&nbsp;June 1932, Papen, although not formally authorized to do so, asked [[Hanns Kerrl]], president of the state parliament and a member of the NSDAP, to replace the caretaker Prussian government with an elected one, something Kerrl was unable to guarantee due to the failure of coalition negotiations to that point.\n[[File:Erich Salomon Paul von Hindenburg 20.jpg|thumb|left|Paul von Hindenburg in 1931]]\nAs a result, Papen considered other possibilities. The first was to carry out the long-debated Reich reform which would have dissolved or divided Prussia. Because such a path would have achieved its goal only in the long term, was difficult to accomplish and highly controversial, he favored another option. He planned to appoint a Reich commissioner in place of the previous government and to enforce the new order, if necessary with the help of the [[Reichswehr]].\n\nFor this he had certain precedents. Reich President [[Friedrich Ebert]] of the SPD had issued a [[Reichsexekution|Reich execution]] ({{Lang|de|Reichsexekution}}) – an intervention against an individual state led by the central government to enforce national law&nbsp;– during 1923's [[German October]]. In the face of Communist Party participation in democratically elected left-wing governments in [[Saxony]] and [[Thuringia]], the forcible removal of the governments had been justified by the fact that peace and order were endangered in the two states. \n\nPapen found an analogous justification for Prussia in the clashes culminating in the [[Altona Bloody Sunday]] of 17&nbsp;July 1932 which involved the [[Sturmabteilung|Nazi SA]], which had just had the ban against it lifted by the Papen government, and the Communists and their supporters. The deadly confrontations and ensuing police action differed markedly from the Reich execution against Saxony in 1923. Then there had indeed been doubts about the loyalty of Saxony's left-wing government to the constitution and its willingness to take police action,<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web |last= |first= |date=14 September 2014 |title=Der 'deutsche Oktober' 1923 |trans-title=The 'German October' 1923 |url=https://www.dhm.de/lemo/kapitel/weimarer-republik/innenpolitik/deutscher-oktober-1923.html |access-date=2022-08-22 |website=Deutsches Historisches Museum |language=de}}</ref> but there was no question of this in Prussia's case.\n\nThree days earlier, on 14 July, Reich President Paul von Hindenburg had at Papen's request signed an undated emergency decree pursuant to [[Article 48 (Weimar Constitution)|Article 48]] of the [[Weimar Constitution]], which allowed the Reich president, with the chancellor's co-signature, to take the necessary measures, including use of the military, to restore public security and order if they were endangered. By means of the decree Hindenburg authorized the Reich Chancellor to become Reich Commissioner for Prussia and enabled him to remove the caretaker Prussian government from office.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Pyta |first=Wolfram |title=Hindenburg.

Papen chose July&nbsp;20.\n\nThe third option, which would have consisted of waiting and leaving Prussia's caretaker minority government in office and trusting that it would get the situation under control even without a parliamentary majority, was one that Papen from the outset did not consider.\n\n== Course of the coup ==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R11405, Carl Severing.jpg|thumb|Carl Severing, 1919]]\nOn 20&nbsp;July 1932 Prussia's Deputy Minister President Heinrich Hirtsiefer, in place of the acting but ill Minister President Otto Braun, along with Interior Minister [[Carl Severing]] and his colleague from the finance department Otto Klepper, went to see Papen at his request. Papen informed the constitutional ministers about the Hindenburg decree that allowed him to be installed as Reich commissioner and for the caretaker government to be removed. He said that the step was necessary because it appeared that \"public safety and order in Prussia could no longer be guaranteed\". A state of emergency was declared with immediate effect, and the Reichswehr minister was appointed as holder of executive power.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Winkler |first=Heinrich August |title=Weimar 1918–1933 |publisher=C. H. Beck |year=1993 |location=Munich |pages=496 ff |language=de}}</ref> Prussia's representatives objected to the coup saying that Prussia had not violated any of its responsibilities under the Reich constitution and its laws, and had done as much for security as the other states even though its jurisdiction included the areas of greatest unrest. The Braun government therefore challenged the constitutionality of the emergency decree. Severing responded negatively to Papen's suggestion that he voluntarily relinquish his official duties, saying that he would \"yield only to force\".<ref>{{Cite news |date=21 July 1932 |title=Der Gewaltakt gegen Preußen |language=de |trans-title=The Act of Violence against Prussia |pages=1 |work=Danziger Volksstimme |url=http://library.fes.de/danzig/pdf/1932/1932-169.pdf |access-date=17 May 2023}}</ref>\n\nOtto Klepper reported a year later in an essay in the exile newspaper ''The New Journal'' that he had hoped that Severing would resist after he made his declaration, especially since both Papen and Interior Minister [[Wilhelm von Gayl]], who was also present, had seemed very uncertain.<ref>{{Cite book |last=von Pufendorf |first=Astrid |title=Otto Klepper (1888–1957) – Deutscher Patriot und Weltbürger |publisher=Oldenbourg |year=1997 |isbn=978-3486562415 |location=Munich |pages=134 f |language=de |trans-title=[Otto Klepper (1888–1957) – German Patriot and Global Citizen]}}</ref> \"I suggested that we recess the meeting with Papen for an hour to discuss further action by the Prussian government and went to the door. But Severing declared that he had nothing more to discuss with me, and remained seated. Only then – after it was certain that no resistance was in the offing&nbsp;– was State Secretary Erwin Planck given the order to set the command to the Reichswehr in motion.\"<ref>{{Cite news |last=Klepper |first=Otto |date=July 1933 |title=Erinnerung an den 20. Juli 1932 |language=de |trans-title=Memories of 20 July 1932 |pages=90 ff |work=Das Neue Tagebuch |publisher=Leopold Schwarzschild |location=Paris / Amsterdam}}</ref>\n\nIn the afternoon of the same day, Severing, who as interior minister commanded a force of 90,000 Prussian police officers, let himself be led out of his office and ministry by a delegation consisting of the police chief whom Papen had just appointed and two police officers. At 11:30&nbsp;a.m. Papen had imposed a military state of emergency under the Reichswehr – a national force of 100,000 men&nbsp;– and, after the Prussian government backed down, occupied the Prussian Interior Ministry, the Berlin police headquarters and the headquarters of the ''[[Schutzpolizei]]'' (protective police).\n\nThe Berlin police chief [[Albert Grzesinski]], his deputy [[Bernhard Weiß (police executive)|Bernhard Weiß]], and the commander of the protective police, the ''Centre Party'' politician [[Magnus Heimannsberg]], were taken into custody and released the next day, after they had bound themselves in writing to engage in no more official acts. Immediately after the dismissal of the state government, a large-scale purge began. Numerous officials who had belonged to the previous coalition parties, especially the SPD, were put on temporary retirement and replaced by conservative officials, the majority of them German nationalists. This step, in addition to affecting the cabinet of Otto Braun, was directed especially against Social Democratic provincial presidents and leading Social Democrats within police organizations. Following a decree issued on 12&nbsp;November 1932, those who had been placed on retirement were either dismissed or delegated to the provinces. In this way 69 ministerial officials with republican sentiments were sidelined. In addition to members of the Braun cabinet, they included among others Carl Steinhoff, vice-president of the province of [[East Prussia]], and Carl Freter, district administrator of [[Calau]] in [[Brandenburg]].\n\nThe purge continued well into 1933. With targeted interventions against the police, especially the political police, an essential part of the power apparatus in Prussia had already been \"cleansed\" before Adolf Hitler's chancellorship. There was hardly any resistance, mainly because the SPD's executive board had decided on July 16 not to resist with the resources available to it in order to avoid provoking a civil war.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal |last=Dierske |first=Ludwig |date=1970 |title=War eine Abwehr des \"Preussenschlages\" vom 20.

Deployment of the Prussian police and the ''[[Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold]]'' – an organization formed by three center and left of center parties to defend parliamentary democracy&nbsp;– was rejected. Even non-violent resistance in the form of a general strike was not considered because it did not seem feasible in view of the high unemployment during the [[Great Depression]]. There was also little prospect of success in a call for civil disobedience by civil servants. If open resistance were to occur, the government anticipated the outbreak of civil war, especially in the event of an armed clash between the Reichswehr and the state police, which it wanted to avoid at all costs. Moreover, legal recourse had not yet been exhausted.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n[[Joseph Goebbels]] noted in his diary on July 21: \"The Reds have missed their great hour.

The petitioners included the State of Prussia, represented by [[Arnold Brecht]] of the Prussian State Ministry, the parliamentary groups of the Social Democratic Party and the Centre Party in the [[Prussian Landtag]], and also the states of [[Bavaria]] and [[Republic of Baden|Baden]]. They disputed the constitutionality of the decree on the grounds that Prussia was not ungovernable as presupposed in the decree. They therefore applied for a preliminary injunction to prohibit the appointed Reich commissioner from performing his duties. The application was rejected on 25&nbsp;July 1932 because the court did not want to anticipate its final decision: in order to declare the emergency decree of the Reich president invalid, reasons would have to be brought forward that were not yet available to the court. The court stated in addition that a temporary injunction was only to be issued if it appeared necessary to avert substantial harm, but any harm Prussia might incur under the emergency decree could not be proven at the time.\n\n=== Oral proceedings ===\nIn the stormy and highly publicized oral hearing, Arnold Brecht pointed out in defense of the State of Prussia that the civil war-like conditions in Prussia that led to the emergency decree had been ignited by the lifting of the ban on uniforms and on the SA on 14 June. The alleged \"inner unfreedom\" of the Prussian government had not existed, but that of the Reich government in its association with the National Socialists had. Brecht tried to prove that the Reich government, in agreement with the National Socialists, had purposefully worked towards removing the Prussian government from office with its preceding measures. In doing so, it had wanted to take the wind out of the National Socialists' sails. \n\nGeorg Gottheiner, an administrative lawyer and [[DNVP]] member, spoke as the main representative of the Reich government. He disputed Brecht's argumentation, saying that there had been no collusion with the National Socialists. Their \"excitement\" had built up precisely because of the Party's \"one-sided treatment\" by the Prussian government. Prussia had fought National Socialism and favored communism. The lifting of the SA ban was supposed to serve as an \"outlet\" for the Nazi's anger.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book |last=Blasius |first=Dirk |url= |title=Weimars Ende: Bürgerkrieg und Politik 1930–1933 |publisher=Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht |year=2005 |isbn=9783525362792 |location=Göttingen |pages= |language=de |trans-title=Weimar's End: Civil War and Politics 1930–1933}}</ref>  \n\n=== Court decision ===\nIn its examination of the existence of a significant disturbance or endangerment of public security and order, the State Court found that the government of Prussia was capable of acting and remained able to act assertively. Paragraph 1 of the emergency decree therefore did not apply: \"In the event of a State not fulfilling the obligations imposed upon it by the Reich Constitution or by the laws of the Reich, the president of the Reich may make use of the armed forces to compel it to do so\" ([[Article 48 (Weimar Constitution)|Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution]]). \n\nThe court found that the facts of paragraph 2 were present: \"If public security and order are seriously disturbed or endangered …, the president of the Reich may take measures necessary for their restoration, intervening if need be with the assistance of the armed forces\" (Article 48). In the words of Richard Wienstein, who was ministerial councilor for constitutional and administrative law issues in the Reich chancellery:<blockquote>The decree of the Reich president of 20 July 1932 for the restoration of public safety and order in the territory of the State of Prussia is compatible with the Reich Constitution insofar as it appoints the Reich chancellor as Reich commissioner for the State of Prussia and authorizes him to temporarily withdraw official powers from Prussian ministers and to assume these powers himself or to transfer them to other persons as commissioners of the Reich. The authorization, however, should not extend to depriving the Prussian State Ministry and its members of the representation of the State of Prussia in the Reichstag, the Reichsrat, or with respect to other states.<ref>{{Cite web |date=11 November 1932 |title=Nr. 177 Notiz des Ministerialrats Wienstein über eine Besprechung am 27.

The true power, however, lay with the representatives of the Reich execution – the \"Commissar Government\" under Franz Bracht. It was not until Adolf Hitler [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power#Seizure of control (1931–1933)|seized power in 1933]] that [[Hermann Göring]], with Papen's help, secured a new emergency decree from Hindenburg that officially deposed Braun's \"sovereign government\".

Therefore, restrictions to personal freedom of the right to free expression of opinion including freedom of the press of the right of association and assembly; interference with the secrecy of correspondence, mail, telegraph and telephone; orders for house searches, and seizures and limitations of property are permissible outside the legal limits otherwise determined for them.\n\n§ 2. Upon the promulgation of this decree, executive power shall pass to the Reich minister of defense, who may transfer it to military commanders. For the implementation of the measures necessary for the restoration of public safety, the entire protective police [{{Lang|de|Schutzpolizei}}] of the designated area shall be directly subordinated to the holder of executive power.\n\n§ 3. Whoever contravenes orders issued by the Reich minister of defense or the military commanders in the interests of public safety or incites or encourages such contravention, shall be punished by imprisonment [{{Lang|de|Gefängnis}}{{Efn|The conditions in a ''Gefängnis'' were geared to the improvement of the offender and thus relatively more favorable for the inmates than the ''Zuchthaus''.}}] or a fine of up to 15,000 Reichsmarks, unless the existing laws provide for a higher penalty. Whoever causes a common danger to human life by an offence according to para. 1 shall be punished with imprisonment [{{Lang|de|Zuchthaus}}{{Efn|''Zuchthaus'' was the most severe form of punishment and included stricter confinement and compulsory work for the inmates. It was also considered to be dishonoring.}}], in extenuating circumstances with {{Lang|de|Gefängnis}} of not less than 6 months and, if the offence causes the loss of human life, with death, in extenuating circumstances with {{Lang|de|Zuchthaus}} of not less than 2 years. In addition, confiscation of property may be imposed. Any person who incites or encourages an offence dangerous to the public (para. 2) shall be punished by {{Lang|de|Zuchthaus}}, and in extenuating circumstances by {{Lang|de|Gefängnis}} for not less than 3 months.\n\n§ 4. The crimes punishable by life imprisonment under Criminal Code §§ 81 (high treason), 302 (arson), 311 (explosion), 312 (flooding), 315 para. 2 (damage to railway installations) shall be punishable by death if committed after the enactment of the decree; under the same condition, the death penalty may be imposed in the case of Criminal Code § 92 (treason); likewise in the cases of § 125 para. 2 (mob ringleaders and those who commit acts of violence as parts of mobs) and § 115 para. 2 (ringleaders and resisters during riots), if the perpetrator has committed the act of resistance by force or threat with weapons or in a conscious and deliberate encounter with armed persons.\n\n§ 5. Upon request of the holder of executive power, extraordinary courts shall be established by the Reich minister of justice. The jurisdiction of these courts shall include, in addition to the offences listed in § 9 of the Decree of the president of the Reich of 29 March 1921 (Reich Law Gazette. p. 371), the misdemeanors and felonies under § 3 of this decree.\n\n§ 6.

It was the first new [[Toronto]] streetcar route in many years, and the first to employ a dedicated tunnel, approximately {{convert|600|metres}} long. The route starts with an underground loop at [[Union station (TTC)|Union station]], runs south along [[Bay Street]] to the underground [[Queens Quay station]], then turns west and emerges onto [[Queens Quay (Toronto)|Queens Quay]]. The line's original terminus was [[Toronto streetcar system loops#Queens Quay and Spadina Loop|Queens Quay and Spadina Loop]], at the foot of [[Spadina Avenue]]; beyond this point [[non-revenue track]] ran north on Spadina to King, to connect the new line with the rest of the network.\n\nNumbers in the 600-series were used at that time within the TTC for rapid transit routes (i.e., subways and the Scarborough RT) rather than single-digit numbers as is the case today, and the Harbourfront LRT was given the number 604 to indicate that it was different from other streetcar routes. The 1990 ''TTC Ride Guide'' indicated the route with its own colour like a subway line rather than as a streetcar route.<ref>[https://transittoronto.ca/archives/maps/rg1990-back.jpg Ride Guide 1990]</ref> Since the route is not grade-separated, this was later felt to be misleading and it was subsequently treated like other streetcar lines, taking the number 510.\n\nIn 1997, the completion of a dedicated right-of-way on Spadina Avenue resulted in the Harbourfront route being relaunched as the [[510 Spadina]]. The \"Harbourfront\" route name disappeared until 2000, when the Queens Quay streetcar tracks were extended west to Bathurst and Fleet Streets. The Harbourfront name was then combined with the new number 509, and extended to [[Exhibition Loop]] at Exhibition Place, sharing its route with the 510 from Union to Spadina and with the [[511 Bathurst]] from Bathurst onwards. Between September 2007 and March 2008, the Fleet Street portion of Route 509 was converted to a parallel private right-of-way, so that the entire route operates entirely separate from road traffic.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://transittoronto.ca/archives/weblog/2007/09/03-fleet_stre.shtml|title=Fleet Street track reconstruction starts tomorrow, September 4 – Transit Toronto – Weblog|website=transittoronto.ca}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://transittoronto.ca/archives/weblog/2008/03/29-streetcars.shtml|title=Streetcars roll along Fleet Street tomorrow – Transit Toronto – Weblog|website=transittoronto.ca}}</ref>\n\n===2012–present===\n[[File:Streetcar heading East between York and Bay streets, Toronto -a.jpg|thumb|left|A CLRV car on the former right-of-way in the median of Queens Quay in 2012]]\nIn July 2012, [[Waterfront Toronto]] began a major reconstruction of Queens Quay West, requiring the 509 streetcar to be replaced with buses for the duration of the construction.<ref>{{cite web |title=Buses to replace TTC's 509 Harbourfront streetcar during Queens Quay revitalization |url=https://www.ttc.ca/news/2012/July/Buses-to-replace-TTCs-509-Harbourfront-streetcar-during-Queens-Quay-revitalization |publisher=TTC |date=26 July 2012}}</ref> On 12 October 2014, streetcar service resumed on 509 Harbourfront route after an absence of over two years in order to rebuild the street to a new design, and to replace tracks. With the new street design, two auto lanes south of the streetcar tracks were eliminated from Spadina Avenue to York Street in order to extend Harbourfront parkland to the edge of the streetcar right-of-way. Thus, streetcars now effectively run on a roadside right-of-way instead of a mid-street median.

Among its principal objectives are investigating and normalising the Asturian Language, developing a dictionary, promoting its use and education and awarding literary prizes. It has 21 full members, 19 foreign members and 15 honorary members, and its current (as of 2006) president is [[Ana Cano|Ana María Cano González]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Oviedo08.jpg|thumb|200px|The sign in front of the old offices in [[Oviedo]].]]\n'''ALLA''' first notice appears in the 18th century, when [[Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos]] and [[Carlos González de Posada]] talk in their letters about the idea of creating it in 1791. Jovellanos' project, however, was aborted because of his imprisonment in [[Majorca]].\n\nIn 1920s the Real Academia Asturiana de las Artes y las Letras (Royal Academy of Asturian Arts and Letters) was created by some intellectuals, including José Antonio García Peláez (Pin de Pría). It was divided in four sections and its principal objectives were to create an Asturian dictionary and grammar and to publish a magazine. Other sections were dedicated to promoting Asturian literature, theatre and music.\n\nBut it was from 1980 when the Asturian pre-autonomous government, the Consejo Regional, approved the creation of the '''ALLA''', founded 15 December of the same year. [[Xosé Lluis García Arias]] was its first president from that moment until 2001 when [[Ana Cano]] took over from him.\n\n==Works==\nIn 1981 the ''Normes Ortográfiques y Conxugación de Verbos'' (''Orthographic Norms and Verb Conjugation''), the first academic work, was published. Other publications followed, such as the ''Gramática de la Llingua Asturiana'' (''Asturian Language Grammar'') in 1998 and the ''Diccionariu de la Llingua Asturiana'' (''Asturian Language Dictionary'') in 2000, also known as «DALLA».\n\nThe '''ALLA''' also publish: \n* a bulletin featuring literary and linguistic studies about the Asturian language, called ''[[Lletres Asturianes]]'' (''Asturian Letters'') [http://www.academiadelallingua.com/comun.php?seccion=lletres] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513155818/http://www.academiadelallingua.com/comun.php?seccion=lletres |date=13 May 2013 }}, \n* and another one with anthropological studies about Asturias: ''Cultures''. \nIt also works as an editorial house, with book collections, such as: \n* ''Escolín'' (''Student'', children literature), \n* ''Llibrería facsimilar'' (''Facsimile library''), \n* ''Cartafueyos de lliteratura escaecida'' (''Notes on forgotten literature'', ancient works in Asturian Language), \n* ''Llibrería llingüística'' (''Linguistic Library'', linguistic studies) [http://www.academiadelallingua.com/comun.php?seccion=publicaciones&id_p=00000004], \n* or ''Llibrería académica'' (''Academical library'', literature).\n\nIt also organised every year the ''Dia de les lletres asturianes'' (Day of Asturian Letters) since 1982, on the first Friday of May.\n\n==List of members==\nAs of 2008, this is the complete list of members of the Academy of Asturian Language<ref>(Asturian) Academy of the Asturian Language website [http://academiadelallingua.com/comun.php?seccion=entamu] (Law 1/98 of use and promotion of Asturian language)</ref>\n\n===Full members===\n* Genaro Alonso Megido\n* Lluis Xabel Álvarez Fernández\n* Ramón d'Andrés Díaz\n* Emilio Barriuso Fernández\n* Xosé Bolado García\n* [[Ana Cano|Ana María Cano González]]\n* Javier Fernández Conde\n* Xosé Lluis García Arias\n* Vicente García Oliva\n* [[Manuel Asur]] González García\n* Xosé Antón González Riaño\n* Roberto González-Quevedo González\n* Xosé Ramón Iglesias Cueva\n* Carlos Lastra López\n* Francisco José Llera Ramo\n* [[Pablo Xuan Manzano Rodríguez]]\n* Josefina Martínez Álvarez\n* [[Miguel Ramos Corrada]]\n* Urbano Rodríguez Vázquez\n* Carlos Rubiera Tuya\n* [[Xuan Xosé Sánchez Vicente]]\n* Isabel Torrente Fernández\n* Mª Josefa Canellada Llavona (†)\n* Lorenzo Novo Mier (†)\n\n===Foreign members===\n* Lourdes Álvarez García\n* [[Xuan Bello]] Fernán\n* Xurde Blanco Puente\n* [[Adolfo Camilo Díaz]] López\n* José Antonio Fernández Vior\n* Félix Ferreiro Currás\n* Xosé Ignaciu Fonseca Alonso\n* Ernesto García del Castillo\n* Corsino García Gutiérrez\n* [[María Esther García López|Mª Esther García López]]\n* Xulio Llaneza Fernández\n* Alfonso Martín Caso\n* Próspero Morán López\n* Marta Mori de Arriba\n* Felipe Prieto García\n* David M.

{"title":"Age fabrication","content":"{{short description|Misrepresenting a person's age}}\n{{refimprove|date=May 2022}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=April 2018}}\n'''Age fabrication''' occurs when people deliberately misrepresent their true age. This is usually done with intent to garner privileges or [[Social status|status]] that would not otherwise be available to that person (e.g. a minor misrepresenting their age in order to garner the privileges given to adults). It may be done through the use of oral or written statements or through the altering, doctoring or forging of [[Vital record|vital records]].\n\nOn some occasions, age is increased so as to make cut-offs for minimum legal or employable age in show business or professional sports. Sometimes it is not the people themselves who lower their public age, but others around them such as [[publicist]]s, parents, and other handlers.  Most cases involve taking or adding one or two years to their age. However, in more extreme cases such as with [[Al Lewis (actor)|Al Lewis]] and [[Charo]], over a decade has been added or subtracted. Official state documents (such as [[birth certificate|birth]], [[marriage license|marriage]] and [[death certificate]]s, the census, and other [[identity document]]s) typically provide the correct date.\n\nAlthough uncommon in modern [[Western society]], it is still possible for a person not to know their exact date of birth, especially if they have been born in a country where birth records were not written until recently. Such a person may arbitrarily choose a date of birth that after later research is found to be false. This situation should not be considered age fabrication as there is no obvious intent to deceive on the part of the individual.\n\nSubtracting time from one's age is often known in English as \"shaving\", while adding time to one's age may be referred to as \"padding\".\n\n==Sports==\n{{See also|Age requirements in gymnastics#Age falsification|Age fraud in association football|Figure skating#Age eligibility|Cheating in baseball#Age fabrication}}\n\nIn sports, people may falsify their age to make themselves appear younger thus enabling them to compete in world-level junior events (with prominent examples appearing in [[Age fraud in association football|football (soccer)]]<ref name=foreveryoung>{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/feb/21/nigerian-football-age-old-problem | title = Forever young: Nigerian football's age-old problem |date = February 21, 2010 |work=The Guardian  | access-date =June 12, 2011}}</ref> and [[sport of athletics|athletics]]).<ref>Amok, Isa (August 10, 2006).

Russian playwright and historian Edward Radzinski argues in his book, ''Stalin'', that Stalin changed the year to 1879 to have a national birthday celebration of his 50th birthday. He could not do it in 1928 because his rule was not absolute enough. The incorrect December 21, 1879, date was printed in many almanacs and encyclopedias during Stalin's reign and remains one of the most widely reported incorrect dates of birth.<ref>[http://www.classicalvalues.com/archives/001189.html When was Stalin born?].

{"title":"Animal rescue group","content":"{{short description|Rescue organization is dedicated to pet adoption}}\n{{about|pet rescue|other uses|Rescue|and|Rescue (disambiguation)|and|Animal rescue (disambiguation)}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{more footnotes|date=January 2014}}\n{{Original research|date=August 2020}}\n}}\nAn '''animal rescue group''' or '''animal rescue organization''' is a group dedicated to [[pet adoption]]. These groups take unwanted, abandoned, abused, or [[feral|stray]] [[pet]]s and attempt to find suitable homes for them.  Many rescue groups are created by and run by [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s, who take animals into their homes and care for them &mdash; including training, playing, handling medical issues, and solving behaviour problems &mdash; until a suitable permanent home can be found.\n\n__TOC__\n\nRescue groups exist for most pet types (reptile rescue, ''rabbit rescue'' or ''bird rescue''), but are most common for [[dog]]s and [[cat]]s.  For animals with many breeds, rescue groups may specialize in specific breeds or groups of breeds.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Chipley|first=Abigail|title=In the News: Gimme Shelter|journal=Vegetarian Times|date=September 2000|issue=177|publisher=Sabot Publishing|page=21}}</ref> For example, there might be local [[Labrador Retriever]] rescue groups, [[hunting dog]] rescue groups, large-dog rescue groups, as well as general dog rescue groups.\n\nAnimal rescue organizations have also been created to rescue and rehabilitate wild animals, such as lions, tigers, and cheetahs; a job which is normally shared or backed by zoos and other conservation charities. These animals are normally released back into the wild where possible, otherwise they will remain in captivity and may be used in breeding for an endangered species.\n\nWidely recognized as an umbrella organization for animal rescue groups, [[Petfinder.org]] is an online, searchable database of more than 13,000 shelters and adoption agencies across the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and [[Mexico]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Sweeney|first=Michael S.|title=Dog Tips From DogTown: A Relationship Manual for You and Your Dog|publisher=National Geographic Society|year=2010|chapter=Further Resources|isbn=9781426206696}}</ref> The [[American Kennel Club]] maintains a list of contacts, primarily within breed clubs, with information on breed rescue groups for purebred dogs in the United States.\n\nAnimal shelters often work closely with rescue groups, because shelters that have difficulty placing otherwise healthy and pet-worthy animals would usually rather have the animal placed in a home than [[animal euthanasia|euthanize]]d; while shelters might run out of room, rescue groups can often find volunteers with space in their homes for temporary placement. Some organizations (such as [[Old Dog Haven]]) work with older animals whose age would likely cause them to be euthanized in county pounds. Each year, approximately 3-4 million cats and dogs are euthanized in shelters due to overcrowding and a shortage of foster homes.<ref>[http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/pet_overpopulation/facts/overpopulation_estimates.html Pets by the Numbers: U.S. Pet Ownership, Community Cat and Shelter Population Estimates] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130425142203/http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/pet_overpopulation/facts/overpopulation_estimates.html |date=2013-04-25 }} Accessed 19 August 2017</ref>\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], both shelter and rescue organisations are described using the blanket term ''rescue'', whether they have their own premises, buy in accommodation from commercial kennels, or operate a network of [[Foster care|foster homes]], where volunteers keep the animals in their homes until adoption.\n\nKennels that have a council contract to take in stray dogs are usually referred to as dog pounds.  Some dog pounds also carry out rescue and rehoming work and are effectively rescue groups that operate a pound service. Some rescue groups work with pounds to move dogs to rescues.  By law, a dog handed in as a stray to a UK pound must be held for seven days before it can be rehomed or [[animal euthanasia|euthanize]]d.\n\nIn the US, there are three classifications for pet rescue:\n\n* A '''municipal shelter''' is a facility that houses stray and abandoned animals, as well as animals that people can no longer care for, on behalf of local governments\n* A '''[[no-kill shelter]]''' is a usually private organization whose policies include the specification that no healthy, pet-worthy animal be euthanized\n* [[non-profit|Not-for-profit]] '''rescue organizations''' typically operate through a network of volunteer foster homes.<ref>{{cite book|last=Biniok|first=Janice|title=The Doberman Pinscher|publisher=TFH Publications|year=2009|isbn=9780793842537}}</ref> These rescue organizations are also committed to a no-kill policy.\n\nMany modern not-for-profit rescue organizations now not only focus on rehoming rescued animals, but rehabilitating and training them as well. Severely abused animals cannot move quickly from their previous environment into a new home. Specialized and trained rescue staff must identify signs of aggression and anxiety and work to remedy these behaviors. Like people, the recovery process is different for all animals. Some might recover immediately while others might always should signs of trauma.\n\n==Rescue groups and shelters==\nThere are two major differences between shelters and rescue groups. Shelters are usually run and funded by [[local government]]s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bial|first=Raymond|title=Rescuing Rover: Saving America's Dogs|page=40|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|year=2011|isbn=9780547341255}}</ref> Rescue groups are funded mainly by donations and most of the staff are volunteers. While some shelters place animals in foster homes, many are housed on-site in kennels. Some rescue groups have facilities and others do not. Foster homes are heavily utilized in either case.\n\nWithin the dog rescue community, there are breed-specific and all-breed rescues.<ref>{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Caroline|title=The Complete Guide to Border Collies|page=50|publisher=Kevin Winslet|year=2007|isbn=9781908793034}}</ref> As its name implies, breed-specific rescues save purebred dogs of a certain breed, for example, Akitas, Boxers, Dalmatians, Labrador Retrievers, etc. Almost every breed is supported by a network of national and international rescue organizations with the goal to save abandoned dogs of this breed. All-breed rescues are not limited to purebred dogs. Instead they save dogs of any breed. Many work with specific shelters to support their efforts.\n\n==Adopting through a rescue group==\nMost rescue groups use similar adoption procedures, including completing an application, checking a veterinary reference, conducting an interview (can be in person or by phone) and a home visit.  Rescue organizations are usually volunteer-run organizations and survive on donations and adoption fees.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cannon|first=Sue|title=Ariel Rescue|journal=Orange Coast Magazine|volume=30|issue=12|date=December 2004}}</ref>  The adoption fees do not always cover the significant costs involved in rescue, which can include traveling to pick up an animal in need, providing veterinary care, vaccinations, food, spaying and neutering, training, and more.\n\nMost animals in the care of rescue groups live with foster home volunteers as members of the family until an appropriate adopter is found. There are a number of different techniques that can be used to make the transition from life at a rescue's foster home to an adoptive home easier on the animal. Generally, rescue groups provide adopters with basic information to aid in a successful transition.\n\nOften, adoption counsellors are involved in the process in order to ensure that the pet is being sent to a good, fitting home. Questionnaires for adoption vary between organizations, but are essentially used to ensure that the animal being adopted suits the lifestyle of the prospect owner and will have all of his or her needs fulfilled.\n\nThe Canadian Federation of Humane Societies accounts for the largest amount of dog and cat shelters in Canada. With 172 shelters throughout the country, it is estimated that 103,000 cats and 46,000 dogs were taken in during 2013.<ref>{{Cite web|title = CFHS {{!}} Animal shelter statistics|url = http://cfhs.ca/athome/shelter_animal_statistics/|website = Canadian Federation of Humane Societes|access-date = 2015-11-17|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151128195230/http://cfhs.ca/athome/shelter_animal_statistics|archive-date = 2015-11-28|url-status = dead}}</ref> Of these, 60% of cats and 49% of dogs were strays, 28% of cats and 34% of dogs were surrendered by their owners, 2% of cats and 3% of dogs were cases of abuse, and the rest were either transferred from neighbouring facilities or born in the shelters themselves.\n\nOf the thousands of animals in shelters in Canada in 2013, only 47% of dogs and 45% of cats were adopted. The remaining majority were left to be euthanized, sent back to their previous owners, or stayed in the shelters, possibly being transferred from one to another hoping for better outcomes.\n\nThe rise of social media has since aided in adoption of pets, as shelters and rescue groups can now post pictures and biographies of the animals on their Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter pages. These outlets allow for people to, often without intention, find suitable pets in need of homes. Online interviews are now also possible, as well as international adoption through many organizations. Developments such as social media pages help shelters find appropriate adopters by venturing outside of their immediate surroundings and creating online networks, allowing more people to be exposed to the information and possibility of animal adoption. Dogs and cats of the Dominican Republic, for example, is an organization that creates profiles for stray animals in the Dominican Republic, and uses an almost entirely online platform to find homes for them, usually overseas, before sending them by plane, spayed and neutered, to be picked up by their new owner.\n\n== Wildlife rescue groups ==\n{{See also|Wildlife rehabilitation}}\nWildlife rescue groups, unlike many other animal rescue organizations, focus on the rehabilitation of sick, injured and orphaned wild animals.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bjorklund|first=Ruth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QVhmDwAAQBAJ|title=Wildlife Rescue and Rehabilitation Worker|publisher=Cavendish Square Publishing|year=2014|isbn=978-1-62712-472-0|edition=First|location=New York|pages=13|oclc=1046678541}}</ref> There are also groups which rescue animals from illegal breeders, roadside circuses, and many other abusive situations.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Guynup|first=Sharon|date=2019-11-14|title=Captive tigers in the U.S. outnumber those in the wild.

{"title":"Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker","content":"{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2023}}\n[[File:Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker 2016.jpg|thumb|Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker in 2016]]\n'''Anne Teresa, Baroness De Keersmaeker''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈɑnə teːˈreːzaː dəˈkeːrsmaːkər}}, born 1960 in [[Mechelen]], Belgium, grew up in Wemmel) is a [[contemporary dance]] choreographer. The dance company constructed around her, {{ill|Rosas (dance ensemble)|fr|Compagnie Rosas}}, was in residence at [[La Monnaie]] in [[Brussels]] from 1992 to 2007.\n\n==Biography==\nDe Keersmaeker did not study dance until her last year of high school, instead studying music, specifically the flute.<ref name = \"dunn98\"/> She studied from 1978 to 1980 at [[Mudra]] in Brussels, a school with links to [[La Monnaie]] and to [[Maurice Béjart]]'s [[Ballet of the 20th Century]]. She has said that the percussionist and her music teacher at MUDRA, {{ill|Fernand Schirren|fr}}, was a major influence on her.<ref name = \"dunn98\">{{Harv|Dunning|1998}}</ref> In 1981, she attended the [[Tisch School of the Arts]] at [[New York University]]. While at the Tisch she presented her first production, ''Asch'' (1980), in Brussels. In 1982 upon her return from the U.S.A. she created ''{{ill|Fase|fr}}, four movements to the music of [[Steve Reich]]''. It was this production that brought her \"a breakthrough on the international dance scene, performing, among other places, at the [[Avignon Festival]]\".<ref>\"The Dance of Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker\". Marianne van Kerkhoven. ''The Drama Review: TDR'', Vol. 28, No. 3, Reconstruction. (Autumn 1984), pp. 98–104.</ref>\n\nThe success of ''Fase'' contributed largely to the foundation of the Rosas in 1983. ''[[Rosas danst Rosas]]'' - Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker's first choreography for the young company to new compositions of [[Thierry De Mey]] and [[Peter Vermeersch]] - brought Rosas the international breakthrough as a company. During the eighties, Rosas was supported by Kaaitheater of Brussels (director Hugo De Greef). Within the framework of Kaaitheater, her oeuvre took shape. Performances such as ''Elena's Aria'' (1984), ''Bartók''/''Aantekeningen'' (1986), a staging of ''Heiner Müller's triptych Verkommenes Ufer''/''Medeamaterial Landschaft mit Argonauten'' (1987), ''Mikrokosmos-Monument Selbstporträt mit Reich und Riley (und Chopin ist auch dabei)''/''In zart fliessender Bewegung - Quatuor Nr.4'', (1987), ''Ottone, Ottone'' (1988), ''Stella'' (1990) and ''Achterland'' (1990) were produced in collaboration with Kaaitheater.\n\nIn 1992, [[La Monnaie]]'s general director [[Bernard Foccroulle]] invited Rosas to become the resident company of Brussels' Royal Opera ''De Munt''/''La Monnaie''. At the start of the residency, Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker set herself three objectives: to intensify the relation between dance and music, to build a repertory, and to launch a dance school (after the disappearance of MUDRA from Brussels in 1988). That year, Rosas created ERTS and released ''Rosa'' - a film of a choreography by Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker to Bartók music directed by [[Peter Greenaway]]. Later that year, Rosas created ''Mozart Concert Arias, un moto di gioia'' for the Avignon Festival. A production made in collaboration with the Orchestre des Champs Elysées, directed by Philippe Herreweghe. In 1993, Rosas created ''Toccata'', to the music of [[J.S. Bach]], for the Holland Festival. In May 1994, the KunstenFESTIVALdes Arts in Brussels premièred ''Kinok'', produced in collaboration with [[Thierry De Mey]] and the [[Ictus Ensemble]]. At the end of 1994, this collaboration resulted in a new creation: ''Amor Constante más allá de la muerte''. In November 1995, La Monnaie premièred ''Verklärte Nacht'', a choreography that was part of a production of [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schönberg]] music ''Erwartung''/''Verklärte Nacht''.\n\nIn 1995, Rosas and La Monnaie launched in Brussels a new international school for contemporary dance, the [[Performing Arts Research and Training Studios]] (PARTS), where sixty students coming from some 25 countries are trained, over a three-year period, by more than 50 teachers.\n\nIn December 1996, ''Woud'', three movements to the music of [[Alban Berg|Berg]], Schönberg & [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] was premièred in Seville. \nAt the beginning of 1997, Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker created, together with Steve Paxton and The Wooster Group, 3 solos for Vincent Dunoyer. In November 1997, ''Just Before'', to a live performance by the Ictus Ensemble of music composed by [[Magnus Lindberg]], [[John Cage]], [[Iannis Xenakis]], Steve Reich, Pierre Bartholomée and Thierry De Mey, was presented in La Monnaie. \n\nIn February 1998, Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker made her debut as an opera director at La Monnaie with [[Béla Bartók|Bartók's]] ''Duke Bluebeard's Castle''. In August 1998, the Impuls Festival in Vienna premièred ''Drumming'', a production to Steve Reich's composition of the same name. In November 1998  she created ''The Lisbon Piece'', for the Portuguese Companhia Nacional de Bailado: her first experience as a guest choreographer. \n\nIn March 1999, Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker created, together with Rosas dancer Cynthia Loemij and Jolente De Keersmaeker and Frank Vercruyssen from the theatre company STAN, ''Quartett''; a dance-theatre performance based on the text by [[Heiner Müller]]. One month later, she choreographed and danced a duet with Elizabeth Corbett for the production ''with/for/by''. In May 1999, Rosas premiered ''I said I'', a collaboration with Jolente De Keersmaeker for the direction, with the Ictus Ensemble, [[Aka Moon]] and [[DJ Grazzhoppa]] for the music composition and execution. Jan Joris Lamers designed the set and lighting and [[Dries van Noten]] the costumes. For ''In Real Time'' in 2000, Rosas again collaborated with Stan, as well as with the jazz-ensemble Aka Moon for the composition and live interpretation of the music.\nIn January 2001, Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker created ''Rain'', another performance to a score by [[Steve Reich]], his ''[[Music for 18 Musicians]]''.\n\n2002 saw the celebration of twenty years of Rosas and ten years of residence at La Monnaie, with the re-run of the text-pieces, the creation of ''(but if a look should) April me'' and ''Rain live'', the two latter accompanied by Brussels contemporary music ensemble Ictus.  A 336 pages book ''Rosas, if and only if wonder'' was published and a multimedia exhibition was organised in newly opened halls at the [[Centre for Fine Arts, Brussels]], and was attended by over 15,000 people. ''Once'', a solo to the music of Joan Baez, concluded the celebration year's performances.\n\n2003 showed yet a new evolution: whereas in the past her choreographies had been very precise and closely linked to the music, in ''Bitches Brew / Tacoma Narrows'', De Keersmaeker for the first time allowed improvisation by her dancers during the performance.\n\nOver the past years, Rosas has also revived several earlier pieces: ''[[Rosas danst Rosas]]'', ''{{ill|Fase|fr}}'', ''Mikrokosmos'', ''Achterland'' and others. Rosas' productions have been invited by theatres and festivals across five continents.\n\nIn October 2011, De Keersmaeker's choreography from \"Rosas Danst Rosas\" and \"Achterland\" was sampled without permission by the R&B singer [[Beyoncé Knowles|Beyoncé]] in the music video for the single ''[[Countdown (Beyoncé Knowles song)|Countdown]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Trueman|first=Matt|title=Beyoncé accused of 'stealing' dance moves in new video|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/oct/10/beyonce-dance-moves-new-video|access-date=8 January 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=10 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Macaulay|first=Alastair|title=In Dance, Borrowing Is a Tradition|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/22/arts/dance/is-beyonce-a-choreography-thief-in-countdown.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all|access-date=8 January 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=21 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2021 she founded the ATDK Foundation a foundation with the intent of safeguarding her artistic legacy, and enable her to share her artistic excellence.<ref>{{Cite web |title=atdkfoundation |url=https://www.atdkfoundation.be/ |access-date=1 January 2023 |website=atdkfoundation |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\nBoth the performances and the films of Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker have been distinguished by various international awards.

In 2011, she received the [[American Dance Festival|American Dance Festival Award]] for her career and at this occasion presented one of her seminal work ''Rosas danst Rosas'' (1983).\n\nThe film ''Hoppla!'' was awarded a Sole d'Oro in Italy and the Grand Prix Vidéo Danse in Sète (1989). The film ''Rosa'' has been distinguished by a Dance Screen Award, got a Special Jury Commendation in the Black and White Short Film Competition at the Film Festival in Cork and was selected for the 49th Mostra Interazionale d'Arte Cinematografica in Venice (1992). In 1994 in Lyon a Dance Screen Award was offered to the film ''Achterland'' (1994), while the film ''Rosas danst Rosas'' obtained the Grand Prix International Vidéo Danse in 1997 and the special prize of the Jury of the International Festival of Film and New Media on Art in Athens in 1998. In 2000, the short film ''Tippeke'' got the Grand Prix Carina Ari of the Festival International Media Dance in Boulogne-Billancourt.\nFurthermore, in June 1995, Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker received the title of Doctor Honoris Causa at the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]]. In March 1996 the government of the province of Antwerp awarded her the Eugène Baie prize, and in May 2000 she was awarded by the French Republic the \"Officier dans l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres\" title.

{"title":"Apostatic selection","content":"{{short description|Process in evolutionary theory}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2016}}\n'''Apostatic selection''' is a form of negative [[frequency-dependent selection]]. It describes the survival of individual [[prey]] animals that are different (through [[mutation]]) from their species in a way that makes it more likely for them to be ignored by their [[predator]]s. It operates on [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphic]] species, species which have different forms. In apostatic selection, the common forms of a species are preyed on more than the rarer forms, giving the rare forms a [[natural selection|selective advantage]] in the population.<ref>Oxford University Press. (2013). Oxford Reference. Retrieved 21 November 2013, from Apostatic Selection: http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095419471</ref>  It has also been discussed that apostatic selection acts to stabilize prey polymorphisms.\n\nThe term \"apostatic selection\" was introduced in 1962 by [[Bryan Clarke]] in reference to predation on polymorphic [[grove snail]]s and since then it has been used as a synonym for negative frequency-dependent selection.<ref>Clarke, B. 1962. Balanced polymorphism and the diversity of sympatric species. Pp. 47–70 in D. Nichols ed. Taxonomy and Geography. Systematics Association, Oxford.</ref>  The behavioural basis of apostatic selection was initially neglected, but was eventually established by A.B Bond.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=J.M|date=May 1984|title=Apostatic Selection on Prey that Match the Background|journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society|volume=23|issue=2–3|pages=221–228|doi=10.1111/j.1095-8312.1984.tb00140.x}}</ref>\n\nApostatic selection can also apply to the predator if the predator has various morphs. There are multiple concepts that are closely linked with apostatic selection. One is the idea of prey switching, which is another term used to look at a different aspect of the same phenomenon, as well as the concept of a [[search image]].  Search images are relevant to apostatic selection as it is how a predator is able to detect an organism as a possible prey. Apostatic selection is important in [[evolution]] because it can sustain a stable equilibrium of morph frequencies, and hence maintains large amounts of genetic diversity in natural populations.<ref name=allen>Allen, J.A. (1988) Frequency-dependent selection by predators. Philos. T. Roy. Soc. B 319, 485–503</ref>\n\nIt is important to note however, that a rare morph being present in a population does not always mean that apostatic selection will occur, as the rare morph could be targeted at a higher rate. From a predator's view, being able to select for rare morphs actually increases the predator's own fitness.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rutz|first=Christian|date=8 May 2012|title=Predator Fitness Increases with Selectivity for Odd Prey|journal=Current Biology|volume=22|issue=9|pages=820–824|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2012.03.028|pmid=22503502|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n==Prey switching==\nIn [[prey switching]], predators switch from primary prey to an alternative food source for various reasons.<ref name=suryan>Suryan, R., Irons, D., & Benson, J. (2000). Prey Switching and Variable Foraging Strategies of Black-Legged Kittiwakes and the Effect on Reproductive Success. The Condor, 374–384.</ref> This is related to apostatic selection because when a rare morph is being selected for, it is going to increase in abundance in a specific population until it becomes recognized by a predator. Prey switching, therefore, seems to be a result of apostatic selection. Prey switching is related to prey preference as well as the abundance of the prey.<ref name=suryan />\n\n== Effects on populations ==\nIt has also been determined that apostatic selection causes stabilization of prey polymorphisms due to the limitations of predators' behaviour.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Bond|first=A.B|date=15 August 2007|title=The Evolution of Color Polymorphism: Crypticity, Searching Images, and Apostatic Selection|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1051&context=bioscifacpub|journal=Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics|volume=38|pages=489–514|doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.38.091206.095728}}</ref> Since the common prey type is more abundant, they should be able to produce more offspring and grow exponentially, at a faster rate then those with the rare morph since they are in much smaller numbers. However, due to the fact that the common morph is preyed upon more frequently, it diminishes their expected rate of reproduction, thus maintaining the population in stable amounts of common and rare morphs.<ref name=\":0\" /> Essentially, unless an environmental change or an evolutionary change in predator or prey occurs, a stable equilibrium is produced.\n\n==Search image==\n[[File:Blue Tit (12416609855).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Blue tit]] searches for insect prey using a [[search image]], leaving scarcer types of prey untouched.]]\n\nA [[search image]] is what an individual uses in order to detect their prey. For the predator to detect something as prey, it must fit their criteria. The rare morph of a species may not fit the search image, and thus not be seen as prey. This gives the rare morphs an advantage, as it takes time for the predator to learn a new search image.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Fraser|first1=B.A|last2=Hughes|first2=K.A|last3=Tosh|first3=D.N|last4=Rodd|first4=F.H|date=October 2013|title=The role of learning by a predator, Rivulus hartii, in the rare‐morph survival advantage in guppies|journal=Journal of Evolutionary Biology|volume=26|issue=12|pages=2597–2605|doi=10.1111/jeb.12251|pmid=24118199}}</ref> Search image shift require multiple encounters with the new form of prey, and since a rare morph is typically not encountered multiple times, especially in a row, the prey is left undetected.  An example of this is how a [[Blue tit]] searches for insect prey using a search image, leaving scarcer types of prey untouched. Predatory birds such as insect-eating [[Tit (bird)|tits (''Parus'')]] sometimes look only for a single cryptic type of prey even though there are other equally palatable cryptic prey present at lower density.<ref>Dukas, Reuven, Kamil, Alan. (2000). Limited attention: the constraint underlying search image. Behavioral Ecology, 192–199.</ref> Luuk Tinbergen proposed that this was because the birds formed a search image, a typical image of a prey that a predator can remember and use to spot prey when that image is common.<ref>Tinbergen, L. (1960). The natural control of insects in pine woods. Factors influencing the intensity of predation by songbirds. Arch. Neerl. Zool. 13:265–343.</ref> Having a search image can be beneficial because it increases proficiency of a predator in finding a common morph type.<ref name=paulson>Paulson, D. (2013). Predator Polymorphism and Apostatic Selection. Society for the Study of Evolution, 269–277.</ref>\n\n==Hypothesis for polymorphism==\nApostatic selection serves as a hypothesis for the persistence of [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]] in a population because of the variation it maintains in prey. Apostatic selection has been referred to as \"selection for variation in its own sake\".<ref name=paulson /> It has been used as an explanation for many types of polymorphism in various species, including diversity in tropical insects. The selective pressure for tropical insects to look as distinct as possible is high because the insects that appear to have the lowest density in a population are the ones that are preyed on the least.<ref>Rand, A. S. (1967). Predator–prey interactions and the evolution of aspect diversity. Atas do Simposio sobre a Biota Amaz6nica 5 (Zool.): 73–83.</ref>\n\n== Environmental mechanisms ==\nIn order for apostatic selection to occur, and for the rare morph to have an advantage, a variety of criteria need to be met. First, there needs to be polymorphism present. In addition, the prey cannot be present in equal proportions, since then there would not be a benefit to being able to detect either one.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last1=Merilaita|first1=Sami|last2=Ruxton|first2=Graeme|date=January 2009|title=Optimal apostatic selection: how should predators adjust to variation in prey frequencies?|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=77|pages=239–245|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2008.09.032|s2cid=53175552}}</ref> This is related to frequency-dependent predation, where as the predator obtains the greatest advantage from having a search image for the most common type of prey. This causes the most common form of the prey to be the most vulnerable.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Horst|first1=Jonathan|last2=Venable|first2=D.L|date=January 2018|title=Frequency‐dependent seed predation by rodents on Sonoran Desert winter annual plants|journal=Ecology |volume=99|issue=1|pages=196–203|doi=10.1002/ecy.2066|pmid=29083479|doi-access=}}</ref> Changes in prey detection by predators do occur, but the speed in which they occur and the flexibility of a predator's search image depend on the environment.\n\nIf the frequency of the different prey types continuously changes, the predator may not be able to change its behavior at a rate that will provide an advantage.<ref name=\":2\" /> In these situations, the predators who are able to change their search image rapidly or have a flexible search image are able to survive. In relation to apostatic selection, rapid changes in prey frequencies can decrease the advantage of the rare morph if their predators have a broad search image or are able to rapidly change their search image.<ref name=\":2\" /> However, rapid changes in polymorphism frequencies can also be an advantage to the prey with the rare morph. Since long periods of time are generally required for natural selection to act on predators, the degree of flexibility in their search image <ref name=\":1\" /> may not be able to be changed over a short time frame.<ref name=\":2\" /> Therefore, quickly arising rare morphs are favored by apostatic selection if the predators are not able to change their behavior and search image in a short time frame. Thus, this is a biological process that is victim to [[evolutionary time delay]].\n\nApostatic selection is strongest in environments in which prey with the rare morphism match their background.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Behavioural basis of apostatic selection ==\nIt has been suggested that in frequency-dependent predation, the number of encounters with the prey shapes the predator's ability to detect prey. This is based on the assumption that when the predator is learning foraging behaviour, it is going to obtain the common form of prey most frequently. Since the predator learns from what is most frequently captured, the most common morph is what is identified as prey.<ref name=\":1\" />  Foraging behaviour is shaped by the learned preference, thus causing apostatic selection and conferring a fitness benefit on the rare prey morphs.<ref name=\":1\" /> From this, it was concluded that search image formation and adaption is the mechanism that causes the most common prey type to be most easily distinguished from its environment, and thus be eaten more frequently than rarer types.\n\n==Experimental evidence==\nVarious types of experiments have been done to look into apostatic selection. Some involve artificial prey because it is easier to control external variables in a simulated environment, though using wild specimens increases the study's [[external validity]]. Often a computer screen simulation program is used on animals, such as birds of prey, to detect prey selection.<ref name=Bond>Bond, A., & Kamil, A. (1998). Apostatic selection by blue jays produces balanced polymorphism in virtual prey. Nature, 594–596.</ref> Another type looks into how apostatic selection can act on the predator as well as the prey, as predator plumage polymorphism can also be influenced by apostatic selection. They hypothesized that a mutant predator morph will become more abundant in a population due to apostatic selection because the prey will not be able to recognize it as often as the common predator morph.<ref name=fowlie>Fowlie, M., & Kruger, O. (2003). The Evolution of plumage polymorphism in birds of prey and owls: the apostatic selection hypothesis revisited. Journal of Evolutionary Biology, 577–583.</ref> Apostatic selection has been observed in both humans and animals, proving that it is not exclusive to lower organisms, and the cognition it requires is applicable to all organisms which display learning. Though a lot of this work has been experimental and lab controlled, there are some examples of it happening in both wild specimens and in the natural habitat of the species.\n\nIn [[hawk]]s, almost all polymorphism is found on their ventral side. It allows for less common coloration to be favored since it will be recognized the least.<ref name=paulson /> Polymorphism is established by foraging strategies, creating opportunities for apostatic selection.<ref name=fowlie /> Because of the different morphs and the varying selection on them, prey perception bias maintains prey polymorphism due to apostatic selection.<ref name=Bond />\n\nApostatic selection can be reflected in [[Batesian mimicry]]. [[Aposematism]] and apostatic selection is used to explain defensive signaling like [[Batesian mimicry]] in certain species.<ref name=matthews>Matthews, E. G. (1997). Signal-based frequency-dependent defense strategies and the evolution of mimicry. The American Naturalist, 213–222.</ref> A paper by Pfenning et al., 2006 looks into this concept. In allopatric situations, situations where separate species overlap geographically, mimic phenotypes have high fitness and are selected for when their model is present, but when it is absent, they suffer intense predation. In Pfenning's article it was suggested that this is caused by apostatic selection because strength of selection is higher on the mimics that have their original model present.<ref>Pfenning, D., Harper, G., Brumo, A., Harcombe, W., & Pfenning, K. (2007). Population differences in predation on batesian mimics in allopatry with their model.

As the mimic becomes more common than the model, the situation reverses and the mimic is preyed upon more often. Therefore, dishonest signals in prey can be selected for or against depending on predation pressure.<ref name=matthews />\n\nAn example of apostatic selection by birds was observed by Allen and Clarke (1968) in ground-dwelling passerines when they presented wild birds in their natural habitat with artificial, dimorphic prey.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|date=November 1968|title=Evidence of Apostatic Selection by Wild Passerines|journal=Nature|volume=220|issue=5166|pages=501–502|doi=10.1038/220501a0|pmid=5686173|last1=Allen|first1=John A.|last2=Clarke|first2=Bryan|bibcode=1968Natur.220..501A|s2cid=4201444}}</ref> The two colors of prey were presented in 9:1 ratios, and then the prey were switched so both colors had an opportunity to be over or underrepresented.<ref name=\":3\" /> In all four of the passerine species that were observed, the more common morph of the artificial prey was consumed more frequently regardless of its color.<ref name=\":3\" /> This study also had a second component in which they allowed the birds to become familiar with one color of the prey, and then presented the dimorphic prey in equal amounts. In this case, the passerines consumed more of the prey that they were accustomed too.<ref name=\":3\" /> This is consistent with the idea that the search image influences apostatic selection: the familiar form that has been encountered more frequently is the preferred prey.\n\nApostatic selection has also been studied in [[cichlid]] fish, which presents a rare polymorphism: the gold ('Midas') colour morph. Torres-Dowall et al. (2017) discussed how apostatic selection is a plausible mechanism for the maintenance of this Midas morph. They concluded that the rare morph is established by a difference in the predator's probability of detecting the Midas morph.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Torres-Dowall|first1=Julian|last2=Golcher-Benavides|first2=Jimena|last3=Machado-Schiaffino|first3=Gonzalo|last4=Meyer|first4=Axel|date=September 2017|title=The role of rare morph advantage and conspicuousness in the stable gold‐dark colour polymorphism of a crater lake Midas cichlid fish|url=http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:bsz:352-2-38e5m3tn47xv6|journal=Journal of Animal Ecology|volume=86|issue=5|pages=1044–1053|doi=10.1111/1365-2656.12693|pmid=28502118|doi-access=free}}</ref> One limitation of this study was that the morphs in the wild were not able to be manipulated.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Frequency-dependent selection]]\n* [[Polymorphism (biology)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Behavioral ecology]]\n[[Category:Selection]]"}

One mile south of the city of Catlettsburg, the site contained an existing refinery which was purchased by Blazer which had been in operation since 1916. The Catlettsburg site was advantageous due to its location near the Ohio River and offered an efficient means of transportation for the fledgling company.  With funds supplied by Swiss Oil, Blazer arranged to buy, at a price of $212,500, the small unprofitable 1,000 barrel per day refinery of Great Eastern Refining Company which had been owned by coal operators in [[Huntington, West Virginia]].

They took over the operations of the [[Catlettsburg Refinery]] which had twenty-five employees who were working seven days per week and twelve hours per day.  Blazer moved from Lexington to Ashland.  The only member of the Swiss Oil organization to come to Ashland with Blazer was Ashland Refining Company's first treasurer, William Waples.<ref name=\"Newc_1956\"/>\n\nAshland's refinery operations in Catlettsburg proved to be successful even from the very first month.  Wages were increased and the hours of work were reduced.  After making repairs and purchasing some new, modern equipment, the refinery soon had output of 500,000 barrels a year (1370 barrels per calendar day) and sales of $1,300,000.  In only a few years, the Ashland Refining Company began to show larger returns than the parent company.<ref name=\"Newc_1956\"/>\nAshland Refining Co. grew rapidly through both internal expansion and acquisitions including Union Gas and Oil Company (1925), Tri-State Refining Company (1930), and Cumberland Pipeline Company (1931).<ref name=\"virg_nces\">{{cite web | url=http://www.virginia.edu/igpr/APAG/apagoilhistory.html | title= Ashland Inc.

In 1936, under Blazer's leadership, the company's ownership changed from Swiss Oil to the Ashland Oil and Refining Company shareholder group and was headquartered in Ashland, Kentucky. Blazer was appointed Chief Executive Officer of the company.\n\nBlazer's success as manager was recognized by major stockholders. They gave him the power to run Ashland as his own operation, though at no point during his tenure as Chief Executive Officer (1936–1957) did he own a controlling interest in the company.<ref name=\"books.google.com\">{{cite book | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=8eFSK4o--M0C&q=kentucky+press+association+kentuckian+of+the+year&pg=PA37| title=John E.

Two of his early changes were offering employees' sick leave with full pay, and in 1947 the introduction of an employee profit-sharing plan. This move made the company one of the first in the region to offer such benefits. Blazer supported creative arts and invited nearby Greenup County educator and internationally acclaimed author [[Jesse Stuart]] to open each annual meeting with a story, a poem, or a bit of humor. He also was a pastor at his local church.\n\n===Post-World War II===\n\nAfter the end of [[World War II]], Ashland teamed with [[Sperry Corporation]] to develop the introduction of radar on commercial river vessels and teamed with various shipyards to develop the integrated tow. The \"jumbo\" tank barge of 195&nbsp;ft. by 35&nbsp;ft. became the industry standard and was used by Ashland. Under Blazer's control, the company grew to become a [[Forbes 500]] company by relying on barges to bring in [[crude oil]] and deliver refined products to independent marketers.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mississippirivermuseum.com/features_halloffame_detail.cfm?memberID=83 | title= National Mississippi River Museum & Aquarium - Achievement Award Winners - Robert \"Bob\" L.

United Carbon was purchased in 1963.<ref name=\"virg_nces\"/>\n\nIn 1966, Ashland Oil and Refinery Company, Inc.'s sales had grown to $699,000,000.\n\nDiversification continued with the purchase of Warren Brothers in 1966, which later was to become Ashland Paving and Construction. A major leap into the chemical industry occurred in 1967 when Ashland purchased ADM Chemical Group.  This chemical distribution segment of the business would go on to be one of the primary functions of the company in the later part of the 20th century. In 1969, the company reorganized to form Ashland Petroleum with [[Robert T. McCowan]] as its first president,<ref>{{cite news |title=News from Ashland |agency=Ashland, Inc. |publisher=Public Affairs Department |date=June 12, 1980}}</ref> as well as entering into a joint venture in [[Coal mining]] under the name [[Arch Coal|Arch Mineral]].\n\n===1980s-1990s===\nIn the 1980s and early 1990s, Ashland continued to expand, buying The Permian Corporation which it merged with [[Scurlock Oil Company]] in 1991 to form a subsidiary known as Scurlock Permian Corporation. In 1992, most of [[Unocal Corporation|Unocal]]'s chemical distribution business was acquired, making Ashland the top chemical distributor in North America. At this time, the Industrial Chemicals & Solvents (IC&S) division was established.

The vessels did not inflict significant damage on each other, however the battle is notable for seeing the first combat use of the self-propelled [[torpedo]].\n\n== Background ==\nIn May 1877, [[Nicolás de Piérola]], former Minister of Finance, initiated an attempt to overthrow then-President [[Mariano Ignacio Prado]]. As part of this coup attempt, on 6 May two of his supporters, Colonel Lorranaga and Major Echenique, boarded ''Huáscar'' at the port of [[Callao]] while the captain and executive officer were ashore. Officers remaining on the ship were part of the plot and persuaded the crew to join their cause. Now in rebel hands, ''Huáscar'' put to sea with [[Luis Germán Astete]] in command. Other Peruvian naval ships present in the port, such as [[USS Catawba (1864)|''Atahualpa'']], were in a state of disrepair and unable to pursue.<ref>{{Cite news | newspaper=The Times |title=The Huascar |date=June 14, 1877 |page=14 |issue=28968 }}</ref>\n\nThe rebels used the ship to harass commercial shipping, especially off Callao, the main commercial port of Peru. However, after she forcibly boarded some British merchant ships, British authorities sent HMS ''Shah'' and HMS ''Amethyst'', under command of Rear Admiral [[Algernon de Horsey]], to capture the vessel, with authorization and reward offered by the Peruvian government of Mariano Ignacio Prado.\n\nOn May 16, it appeared in the port of Antofagasta, Bolivia, where he picked up Nicolás de Piérola, as Supreme Chief of Peru, and his entourage of followers..\n\n== Battle ==\n''Huáscar'' escaped after a fierce exchange of fire. Her guns were undermanned, and she fired just 40 rounds. ''Shah''{{'}}s mast was damaged by splinters. On the British side, ''Shah'' fired 237 shots and ''Amethyst'' 190, but they carried no armour-piercing ammunition. ''Huáscar'' was hit 60 times, but her armour shield caused all the shots to bounce off harmlessly. In a last-ditch effort to sink ''Huáscar'', two small [[torpedo ram]]s from ''Shah'' attempted to torpedo her, but ''Huáscar'' escaped under the cover of darkness. The rebel crew was forced to surrender their ship to the Peruvian government ships squadron just two days later.\n\nThis battle saw the first use of the newly invented self-propelled [[torpedo]], which at the time had just entered limited service with the [[Royal Navy]]. The monitor''Huáscar'' evaded the torpedo.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20040803142718/http://members.lycos.co.uk/Juan39/BATTLE_OF_PACOCHA.html Britons And Peruvians Fight At Sea]\n\n{{coord missing|Pacific Ocean}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pacocha}}\n[[Category:Naval battles involving the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Naval battles involving Peru]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1877]]\n[[Category:International maritime incidents]]\n[[Category:Peru–United Kingdom relations]]\n[[Category:Maritime incidents in May 1877]]\n\n\n{{UK-battle-stub}}"}

Beant fired three rounds into her abdomen from his .38 (9.7&nbsp;mm) revolver, then Satwant fired 30 rounds from his Sterling sub-machine gun after she had fallen to the ground. Both men then threw down their weapons, and Beant said \"I have done what I had to do. You do what you want to do.\" In the next six minutes, Border Police officers Tarsem Singh Jamwal and Ram Saran captured and killed Beant because one of the guards was using derogatory words against the Sikh community which prompted Beant Singh to empty a pitcher of water on the guard, and in return other guards shot Beant Singh to death, while Satwant was arrested by Gandhi's other bodyguards. Both Satwant Singh and Beant Singh never tried to run away from the guards or the custody; Satwant Singh was seriously wounded by the guards.

It is on the [[Midland Main Line]] from [[St Pancras railway station|London St Pancras]] to the [[East Midlands]] and the terminus of the [[Marston Vale line]] from [[Bletchley railway station|Bletchley]] through [[Bedford St Johns railway station|Bedford St Johns]].\n\n== History ==\nThe original station was built by the [[Midland Railway]] in 1859 on its line to the [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern]] at [[Hitchin]]. It was on land known as \"Freemen's Common\" approximately {{convert|200|yd|m}} south of the current station on Ashburnham Road.\n\nThe [[London and North Western Railway]] (LNWR) also had a station on its line between {{rws|Bletchley}} and {{rws|Cambridge}}. The Midland crossed it on the level and there was a serious collision when an LNWR train passed a red signal. (Curiously,  both drivers were named John Perkins). Following this accident, the Midland built a flyover in 1885.<ref>Radford, B., (1983) ''Midland Line Memories: a Pictorial History of the Midland Railway Main Line Between London (St Pancras) & Derby'' London: Bloomsbury Books.</ref>\n\nThe extension to {{rws|St Pancras}} opened in 1868.  The connection to {{rws|Hitchin}} ceased public services during 1961, but the line north of Bedford to Wigston Junction is still officially referred to as the Leicester to Hitchin line.<ref>Jacobs, G., ''(Ed)'' (2005 2Rev) ''Railway Track Diagrams: Midlands and North West: Book 4 Chart 2,3'' Bradford on Avon:TRACKmaps.</ref> At this time the station was substantially altered, with the replacement of a level crossing by the Queen's Park overbridge. In 1890 fast lines were added to the west to allow expresses to bypass the station.\n\nSerious damage occurred during [[World War II]] when a bomb destroyed the booking hall's glass ceiling. The current station was built to replace it and was opened by [[Peter Parker (British businessman)|Sir Peter Parker]] (chairman of [[British Rail|BR]]) on 9 October 1978.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Railway Magazine |date=June 1979 |page=267 |volume=125 |issue=938 |editor-first=J.N. |editor-last=Slater |location=London |publisher=IPC Transport Press |title=Bedford Electrification On Schedule }}</ref><ref name=\"MR-1978\">{{cite journal|editor-first=Charles|editor-last=Long|title=Bedford station opened|journal=[[Modern Railways]]|date=December 1978|volume=35|number=363|page=544}}</ref> The £1 million station, which was re-sited about {{convert|110|yd|m}} north of the original 1857 station, had a large square concourse housing a ticket office, travel centre and [[Travellers Fare]] buffet.<ref name=\"MR-1978\"/> The station car park was enlarged to cater for 450 cars plus 52 short-wait spaces in the forecourt which had separate areas for cars and taxis to set down and pick up passengers.<ref name=\"MR-1978\"/> A covered walkway linked the station with bus stops in Ashburnham Road.<ref name=\"MR-1978\"/> As part of the modernisation work, the slow lines were realigned to the west next to the 1890 fast lines to pass between two new platforms.<ref name=\"MR-1978\"/>\n\nAlthough the intention was for what remained of the old awnings to be transferred to the [[Midland Railway - Butterley|Midland Railway]] at [[Butterley]] in [[Derbyshire]] it proved impossible to save them. Nothing remains of the original station buildings.\n\nServices over the Marston Vale line to/from {{rws|Bletchley}} were transferred here from the old LNWR St Johns station in May 1984.  A new connection, which runs along the formation formerly used by the abandoned line to Hitchin (closed to passenger traffic from 1 January 1962 and completely three years later), was laid from the Marston Vale branch up to the main line to permit this. The original [[Bedford St Johns railway station|St Johns]] station closed on 14 May 1984 with a replacement halt on the new chord opening the same day.<ref>[http://www.disused-stations.org.uk/b/bedford_st_johns/ Station Name - Bedford St Johns] ''Disused Stations Site Record''; Retrieved 23 August 2016.</ref>  Bletchley trains henceforth used a bay platform (numbered 1A) on the eastern side of the station.\n\nBy 1983, Midland Main Line electrification under British Rail reached Bedford, and [[British Rail Class 317|Class 317]] [[electric multiple unit]]s began running to {{rws|Moorgate}}.

Cheney is most famous for helping build [[Cheney Stadium]] in Tacoma, personally contributing $100,000 to cover construction overruns of the stadium.
