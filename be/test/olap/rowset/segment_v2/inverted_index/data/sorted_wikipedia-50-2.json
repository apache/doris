It is based on Robert MacLeod's 1966 novel ''The Californio''. The film was shot in Spain. The original music score was composed by [[Jerry Goldsmith]], who had previously also scored ''[[Bandolero!]]'', another Western starring Welch.<ref name=\"Filmtracks.com\">{{cite web|last=Clemmensen|first=Christian|url=http://www.filmtracks.com/composers/goldsmith.shtml|title=Jerry Goldsmith (1929–2004) tribute|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111101175348/http://www.filmtracks.com/composers/goldsmith.shtml |archive-date=1 November 2011 |publisher=[[Filmtracks.com]] |access-date=11 February 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1912 [[Sonora]], [[Mexico]], Arizona lawman Lyedecker chases Yaqui Joe, a half-[[Yaqui]], half-white bank robber who has stolen $6,000. Both men are captured by the Mexican general Verdugo.\n\nLyedecker learns that Joe used the loot to buy 100 rifles for the Yaqui people, who are being repressed by the government. Lyedecker is not interested in Joe's motive, and intends to recover the money and apprehend Joe to further his career.\n\nThe two men escape a Mexican firing squad and flee to the hills, where they are joined by Sarita, a beautiful Indian revolutionary. Sarita has a vendetta against the soldiers, who murdered her father. The fugitives become allies. The soldiers raid and burn a village that the rebels have just left, taking its children as hostages. Sarita tells Lydecker that she will allow him to take Yaqui Joe with him back to Phoenix afterwards if he stays with them to help rescue the children. She later warms up to Lyedecker and they make love.\n\nLeading the Yaqui against Verdugo's forces, they ambush and derail the General's train and overcome his soldiers in an extended firefight. Sarita is killed in the battle. Lyedecker decides to return home alone and allow Yaqui Joe to take over as the rebel leader.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jim Brown]] as Sheriff Lyedecker\n* [[Raquel Welch]] as Sarita\n* [[Burt Reynolds]] as Joe \"Yaqui Joe\" Herrera\n* [[Fernando Lamas]] as General Verdugo\n* [[Dan O'Herlihy]] as Steven Grimes, the railroad rep.\n* [[Eric Braeden]] (credited as Hans Gudegast) as Lieutenant Franz Von Klemme\n* [[Michael Forest]] as Humara\n* [[Aldo Sambrell]] as Sergeant Paletes\n* [[Soledad Miranda]] as prostitute in hotel\n* Alberto Dalbés as Padre Francisco (Alberto Dalbes)\n* Charly Bravo as Lopez (Carlos Bravo)\n* [[José Manuel Martín]] as Sarita's Father (Jose Manuel Martin)\n* [[Akim Tamiroff]] as General Romero (scenes deleted)\n* [[Sancho Gracia]] as Mexican Leader (uncredited)\n* [[Lorenzo Lamas]] as Indian Boy (uncredited)\n\n==Production==\n{{Too many quotes|section=section|both=both|date=August 2023}}\n\n===Development===\nThe film was the first of a four-picture deal between producer Martin Schwartz and [[20th Century Fox]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Martin, Betty|date=31 May 1967|title='Insurgents' for Crenna|work=Los Angeles Times|page=d12}}</ref> It was based on a novel by Robert McLeod, and the script was originally written by Clair Huffaker.<ref>{{cite news|author=Scheuer, Philip K.|date=13 August 1967|title=The One-Man Revolt in Hollywood|work=Los Angeles Times|page=c14}}</ref>\n\nTom Gries signed to direct following his successful feature debut with ''[[Will Penny]]''.

Brown later said:\n<blockquote>The thing I wanted to avoid most was any suggestion that I was coming on to her. So I withdrew. If I'd tried to socialise, we'd have had problems.  You know, Raquel is married too and out of respect for her husband I wanted to deal with Raquel through him... She was so suspicious and concerned that we were there to steal something away, or something. You can get very hung up on who's going to get the close ups and so on... [Burt Reynolds] was usually a stabilising influence [between the stars]... He's a heck of a cat.

And it was really, in all seriousness, as ambiguous as hell. I don't know why it happened and I don't think Jimmy knows why it happened... My attitude on a film has always been, once it goes I'm interested only in my job. I'm not interested in asserting myself on a picture. Because it means too much to me.<ref name=\"times\"/></blockquote>\n\"I spent the entire time refereeing fights between Jim Brown and Raquel Welch\", said Reynolds.<ref>{{Cite news|author=BURT PRELUTSKY|title=Two Centerfolds.|work=Los Angeles Times|date=24 December 1972|page=k14}}</ref> He elaborated:\n<blockquote>It started because they were kind of attracted to each other. After a while they both displayed a little temperament, but don't forget we were out in the middle of the bloody desert with the temperature at 110. Of course, I don't think they'll ever work together again. The critics have really been knocking those two – murdering them – but as far as I know no one ever said they were [[Alfred Lunt|Lunt]] and [[Lynn Fontanne|Fontanne]]. Jim is the most honest man I know... And Raquel – one of the gutsiest broads I know, physically. She did all her own stunts. There's also a performance in there somewhere.<ref name=\"burt\"/></blockquote>\nWelch later said she \"was the baloney in a cheesecake factory\" on that film. \"I wanted to keep up with all the action with the boys.\" She was sorry Tom Gries \"wanted to get all the sex scenes [with Jim Brown] in the can in the first day. There was no time for icing – and it made it difficult for me.\" She says Brown \"was very forceful and I am feisty. I was a little uncomfortable with too much male aggression. But – it turned out to be great exploitation for the film, now as you look back. It broke new ground.\"<ref>{{cite news | url=https://variety.com/2008/scene/columns/1968-welch-gets-cozy-with-co-star-1117992047/ | title=1968: Welch gets cozy with co-star | author=Army Archerd | work=Variety | date=11 September 2008 | access-date=11 December 2017 | archive-date=10 December 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171210231709/http://variety.com/2008/scene/columns/1968-welch-gets-cozy-with-co-star-1117992047/ | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe film opened on 26 March 1969 and grossed $301,315 in its first five days from nine cities.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=This Picture Has a Message (Advert)|url=https://archive.org/details/sim_variety_1969-04-02_254_7/page/23|date=2 April 1969|page=23}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Fox records the film required $8,225,000 in rentals to break even and by 11 December 1970 had made $6,900,000 so made a loss to the studio.<ref>{{cite book|page=328|title=The Fox that got away : the last days of the Zanuck dynasty at Twentieth Century-Fox|last=Silverman|first=Stephen M|year=1988|publisher=L.

Development stagnated beginning in 2004 and entirely stopped in early 2005.

No update for the original AdBlock was issued even after Firefox 1.5's release in November 2005. An official update supporting 1.5 was released more than a month later.

Most of the content that users are trying to block will be removed, though some content is missed, and the app is not as reliable at blocking ads as the browser versions. The app can be configured to auto-start every time the device reboots, minimizing the action required by the user.\n\n===Filters===\nBasic filter rules can include wildcards represented by asterisks (<code>*</code>). Sites and objects can be whitelisted with filters that start with two ''at'' signs (<code>@@</code>). [[Regular expression]]s delimited by slashes (<code>/</code>) can be used by advanced users. Adblock Plus also supports a more-sophisticated syntax that gives fine-grain control over filters.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://adblockplus.org/en/filters#options |title=Writing Adblock Plus filters |publisher=Adblockplus.org |access-date=November 4, 2011 |archive-date=November 3, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103214109/http://adblockplus.org/en/filters#options |url-status=live }}</ref>\nAn example of the sophisticated filtering would be <code>wikipedia.org##div#centralNotice</code>, which will hide the centralNotice element used by Wikipedia to display donation requests. The first part of the filter is the domain name, followed by two pound signs, and a [[CSS|CSS selector]]. This type of filtering is called cosmetic filtering, as it hides parts of the website after it has loaded. Both [[uBlock Origin]] and [[AdGuard|AdGuard's browser extension and apps]] also support this type of filtering.\n\n===Filter subscriptions===\nUsers can add external filtersets. Adblock Plus includes the ability to use one or more external filter subscriptions that are automatically updated. [[Filterset.G]] is incompatible with this system (and Adblock Plus specifically recommends against using Filterset.G for other reasons as well), but other filtersets can be added by typing their addresses.

It was released by [[Columbia Records]] on February 20, 1996, as the third single in the United States and fourth worldwide. Written and produced by Carey, [[Jermaine Dupri]] and [[Manuel Seal]], \"Always Be My Baby\" is a [[Tempo|midtempo]] song, with lyrics describing the feeling of attachment and unity the singer feels towards her estranged lover, even though they are no longer together, she says he will always be a part of her and will \"always be her baby\" even after they move on.\n\n\"Always Be My Baby\" received critical acclaim with reviewers praising its mellow production and Carey's vocals. The song was a commercial success, becoming Carey's eleventh chart topper on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]], tying her with [[Madonna]] and [[Whitney Houston]] for most number-one singles by a female artist at the time. It spent two weeks atop the chart and became Carey's eighth chart-topper on the Canadian [[RPM (magazine)|''RPM'' Top Singles]] chart. The song is [[Music recording certification|certified]] five-times platinum in the US with 1,254,000 units coming from physical sales, 890,000 coming from digital sales, and 856,000 coming from streaming equivalent units. It is also certified platinum by RIAA for selling 1 million units as master tone in the US by 2007. In other regions, the single performed well, peaking at number three in the United Kingdom, number five in New Zealand, number 17 in Australia and in the top 20 in most music markets where it charted.\n\nThe accompanying music video for \"Always Be My Baby\" features scenes of Carey frolicking by a campsite in upstate New York, as well as swinging on a Cooper Tire over a lake. Additional inter-cuts include scenes of two children, one male and female, sneaking out at night and spending time together by a campfire similar to Carey's location. Most scenes from the video were filmed at [[The Fresh Air Fund]]'s Camp Mariah, named after Carey for her generous support and dedication to Fresh Air Fund children. The song was performed live during her [[Daydream World Tour]] (1996) and many of her future tours and concerts. \"Always Be My Baby\" was also featured in Carey's compilation albums: ''[[Number 1's (Mariah Carey album)|#1's]]'' (1998), ''[[Greatest Hits (Mariah Carey album)|Greatest Hits]]'' (2001), ''[[The Ballads (Mariah Carey album)|The Ballads]]'' (2008) and ''[[Number 1 to Infinity|#1 to Infinity]]'' (2015). The U.S. and Canadian [[B-side]] \"Slipping Away\" is included in the compilation album ''[[The Rarities (Mariah Carey album)|The Rarities]]'' (2020).\n\n== Background and recording ==\nWhile Carey was writing and commencing the recording of ''Daydream'' from late 1994, she began searching for different producers, in order to give her work a new sound.<ref name=\"bronson\">{{harvnb|Bronson|2003|p=845}}</ref> [[Jermaine Dupri]], who had risen to fame during that period and previously remixed Carey's song \"[[Never Forget You (Mariah Carey song)|Never Forget You]]\" for its single release in 1994, began working with Carey on material for her album. After recording the song in December 1994, Carey recalled that she chose to work with Dupri because he had a \"very distinct vibe.\"<ref name=\"bronson\" /> Additionally, Carey commissioned the assistance of [[hip hop|hip-hop]] and [[contemporary R&B]] producer, [[Manuel Seal]]. As Seal played different keys on the piano, Carey led him with the melody she was \"hearing inside her head\" and began humming the phrase \"always be my baby.\"<ref name=\"bronson\" /> In an interview with [[Fred Bronson]], Carey discussed the process it took to write and produce the song:\n<blockquote>\nJermaine, Manuel and I sat down and Jermaine programmed the drums. I told him the feel I wanted and Manuel put his hands on the keyboards and I started singing the melody. We went back and forth with the bridge and the B-section. I had the outline of the lyrics and started singing 'Always be my baby' off the top of my head.<ref name=\"bronson\" />\n</blockquote>\n\"Always Be My Baby\" marked the first of several collaborations between Carey and Dupri.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://people.com/music/mariah-carey-number-one-hits-complete-guide/|title=A Complete Guide to All of Mariah Carey's Number One Hits|last=Runtagh|first=Jordan|date=April 11, 2018|website=People|access-date=November 20, 2018|archive-date=January 15, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230115111523/https://people.com/music/mariah-carey-number-one-hits-complete-guide/|url-status=live}}</ref> Like producers before him, Dupri commended Carey's vocal abilities, \"she can pretty much do anything with her voice. She's really strong vocally.\"<ref name=\"bronson\" /> Another musical craft the song featured was the inclusion of heavy background vocals of her lower registers, with Carey then belting and singing the higher notes over her background vocals and melody, creating a \"double voice effect\".<ref name=\"bronson\" /> When discussing the technique used in the background vocals, Carey said:\n<blockquote>\nThe background vocals are an important part of the picture for me. That's why I like to do them myself a lot of the time, or initially I'll lay down the tracks. I'll double my voice or do a couple of tracks of my own voice. It's easy for me to match my voice. And then if I'm going to use other background singers, I'll let them go on top of mine.<ref name=\"bronson\" />\n</blockquote>\n\n== Composition ==\n{{listen\n| filename     = Alwaysbemybaby.ogg\n|

The video was filmed on location at Carey's sponsored charity, [[the Fresh Air Fund]] upstate New York camp.<ref name=\"nickson\" /> The video begins with scenes of Carey, in a denim jacket, jeans, and bare feet, on a lakeside tire-swing, smiling and beginning to retell a story of young love. As she sits upon the swing, scenes of two children sneaking out of their [[bungalow]] in the middle of the night are shown. They frolic together beside a fireplace, soon coming up to the lakeside swing Carey had been on before. They soon go swimming wearing their clothes, much like Carey did in her video for \"[[Dreamlover (song)|Dreamlover]]\" though she does not jump into the water herself this time. As they jump into the water, Carey is then seen by the campfire they passed on their journey to the lake, smiling with friends and enjoying herself by the fire. Eventually the boy and girl are seen kissing underwater. The video concludes with scenes of the young boy and girl walking together back to their bungalow, walking hand-in-hand. Having possibly witnessed the entire event, Carey is seen once again by the large swing, chuckling and staring into the night's sky.<ref name=\"nickson\" /> On August 14, 2020, the music video was re-released in a [[remastered]] form, in [[High-definition video|HD]] quality.\n\nAn alternate video was shot for the song's remix. It too was directed by Carey, and was shot in black and white. The shot of Carey in a beret that would become the cover for this single is a scene from the video. The video features Da Brat and Xscape and a cameo appearance by Jermaine Dupri.<ref name=\"nickson\" /> It begins with Carey and the others recording in Carey's in-home studio. In the video, Carey is wearing a large white, puffy jacket and long golden hair. Scenes of Carey by her indoor pool are shown, with cameos made by her dog, Jack.  Da Brat and Xscape are seen poolside with Carey, playing cards and drinking beer, as they further bond and laugh.  Towards the end of the video, scenes of the studio are shown, intermingled with snippets of Carey walking inside the mansion she shared with then-husband [[Tommy Mottola]]. The video ends with Carey and Da Brat bonding by the studio and pool.<ref name=\"nickson\" />\n\n== Live performances and cover versions ==\nCarey performed the song throughout the entire run of her [[Daydream World Tour]] (1996), [[Rainbow World Tour]] (2000), [[The Adventures of Mimi Tour|The Adventures of Mimi]] (2006), [[The Elusive Chanteuse Show]] (2014), [[Caution World Tour]] (2019) and during select shows on her [[Charmbracelet World Tour: An Intimate Evening with Mariah Carey|Charmbracelet World Tour]] (2002–03),  and [[Angels Advocate Tour]] (2009–10). During the Japanese shows in 1996, Carey donned a white suit and jacket, and featured three female back-up singers. Red spotlights were used throughout the performance, as well as some light dance routines{{citation needed|date=October 2021}} During her Rainbow World Tour, Carey wore a two piece outfit, a pair of pants and top, with golden heels. Three back-up singers were provided, one male and two female, while Carey interacted with the front row fans.{{citation needed|date=October 2021}} On her Adventures of Mimi Tour in 2006, Carey donned a pair of black leggings, worn with a bikini-like top. Wearing [[Christian Louboutin]] pumps, Carey sang on the arena's secondary stage, where she sang three of the set-list's titles.{{citation needed|date=October 2021}} On her Elusive Chanteuse Show in 2014, Carey often used the song as her encore, entering the stage in a tight-fitted blue gown and black gloves. Carey included the song in her 2015 Las Vegas residency, [[Mariah Carey Number 1's (residency)|Mariah Carey Number 1's]], where she walked through the audience for the second verse and chorus. Carey also included the song in her 2018–2019 Las Vegas residency [[The Butterfly Returns]], where she was accompanied by her children Moroccan and Monroe in selected dates.\n\nOn the [[American Idol (season 7)|seventh season]] of ''[[American Idol]]'', [[David Cook (singer)|David Cook]] performed a [[Rock music|rock]] arrangement of the song during the April 15, 2008, episode, in which Carey mentored the contestants on her songs.<ref name=\"ai\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1585646/20080416/carey_mariah.jhtml|title='American Idol' Recap: Teary David Cook, Powerful David Archuleta Master Mariah Carey Night|last=Cantiello|first=Jim|work=[[MTV News]]|publisher=MTV|date=April 16, 2008|access-date=December 10, 2010| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100420075813/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1585646/20080416/carey_mariah.jhtml | archive-date = April 20, 2010|url-status = dead}}</ref> His version received high praise from all three judges, and even Carey herself.

Known as the \"Mr. Dupri Mix\", it features re-sung vocals with all of the lyrics and most of the melodic structure retained while using a sample of the song \"[[Tell Me If You Still Care]]\" by [[The SOS Band]].  It includes a rap from [[Da Brat]] and background vocals from [[Xscape (band)|Xscape]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-54340236|title=The Meaning Of Mariah Carey: Six revelations from the singer's memoir|work=BBC News|date=September 29, 2020|access-date=May 7, 2021|archive-date=April 11, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210411181703/https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-54340236|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"ABMBCN2\" />\n\nCarey recorded yet another set of vocals for dance remixes produced by [[David Morales]] that were initially only released on maxi-single in the UK until their release in the US as part of \"#MC30\", a promotional campaign marking the 30th anniversary of Carey's self-titled debut.<ref name=\"MC30MCABMB\" /> The main dance remix, named the \"Always Club Mix\" (along with its edit, the \"Def Classic Radio Mix\"), has a totally new melodic structure and lyrics altered to fit the new melody and song structure. DJ [[Satoshi Tomiie]] also created a dance [[Dub music|dub]] that used these new vocals; calling it the \"ST Dub\", it appeared on the maxi-single that included the Morales mixes.<ref name=\"ABMBCN2\" />\n\n=== Other versions ===\nThe original album vocals were also remixed into a reggae version that included Jamaican-American reggae rap artist [[Vicious (rapper)|Li'l Vicious]].  Called the \"Reggae Soul Mix\", this remix includes a rap breakdown by Vicious, with him shouting over Carey's vocals throughout the track.\n\nIn 2021, Carey recorded a new version of the song which was included in the [[HBO Max]]'s animated television special, ''[[The Runaway Bunny (TV special)|The Runaway Bunny]]'' based on the [[The Runaway Bunny|book of the same name]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://decider.com/2021/04/08/the-runaway-bunny-hbo-max-adaptation/|title='The Runaway Bunny' on HBO Max Will Make Millennials Sob|access-date=May 7, 2021|website=Decider|date=April 8, 2021|archive-date=May 7, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210507064744/https://decider.com/2021/04/08/the-runaway-bunny-hbo-max-adaptation/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Track listings ==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n* '''Worldwide CD single'''<ref name=\"ABMBCN2\">{{cite AV media notes|title=Always Be My Baby|others=[[Mariah Carey]]|date=1996|type=US CD Single liner notes|publisher=[[Columbia Records]]|id=44K 78277}}</ref><ref name=\"ABMBCN1\">{{cite AV media notes|title=Always Be My Baby|others=[[Mariah Carey]]|date=1996|type=UK CD Single liner notes|publisher=[[Columbia Records]]|id=663334 2}}</ref>\n# \"Always Be My Baby\" (album version) – 4:19\n# \"Always Be My Baby\" (Mr. Dupri Mix) [feat.

It is located on the shores of Granby Bay in coastal [[Observatory Inlet]], about {{convert|60|km|mi|0|abbr=off}} southeast of (but without a land link to) [[Stewart, British Columbia]], and about {{convert|20|km|mi|0|abbr=off}}, across wilderness east of the tip of the [[Southeast Alaska|Alaska Panhandle]].\n\n==Early history==\nThe remote valley was long a hunting and trapping area for the [[Nisga'a]], and the name Anyox means “hidden waters” in the [[Nisga'a language]].<ref name=Relics>{{cite AV media | people=Muir, Andrew (Writer, Director) |date=2018 | title=Relics | medium=Documentary | location=Canada | publisher=Straycat Media}}</ref>  The first Europeans in the area were the members of the [[Vancouver Expedition]], who surveyed the inlet in 1793.\n\nNisga'a legends told of a mountain of gold, attracting speculators for years. In 1910, the [[Granby Consolidated Mining, Smelting and Power Company]] (Granby Consolidated) started buying land in the area. They soon found gold.<ref name=Relics/>\n\n==Town and mines==\nGranby Consolidated started construction of the town in 1912. By 1914, Anyox had grown to a population of almost 3,000 residents, as the mine and smelter were put into full operation; rich lodes of copper and other precious metals were mined from the nearby mountains. Granby Consolidated moved its copper mining interests here from  [[Phoenix, British Columbia|Phoenix]], British Columbia. Copper was mined from the Hidden Creek and Bonanza deposits and smelted on site. [[Coal]] to fuel the [[smelter]] was shipped from the company built and owned town of Granby on [[Vancouver Island]] and [[Fernie, British Columbia|Fernie]] in southeastern British Columbia.\n\nAnyox had no rail or road links to the rest of British Columbia, and all connections were served by ocean steamers, which traveled to [[Prince Rupert, British Columbia|Prince Rupert]] ({{convert|145|km|mi|abbr=on|0}}  southwest)<ref>{{cite web |url=https://blogs.unbc.ca/unbcexptour/category/the-town-that-got-lost-anyox-exploration/ |title=The Mystery of the \"STOLEN\" Anyox Light Bulbs! |author=Brycer |publisher=[[University of Northern British Columbia]] |date=2018-02-28 |accessdate=2018-09-14}}</ref>  and [[Vancouver]].\n\nThe company town was a very large operation, with onsite railways, machine shops, curling rink, golf course and a hospital. In the spring of 1918, Granby Consolidated built the first wooden tennis court in Canada for additional recreation. The same year, incoming ships brought the [[1918 influenza pandemic|Spanish flu epidemic]] to Anyox. Charles Clarkson Rhodes, the Chief Accountant for the Granby Consolidated operations in Anyox, died on October 29, 1918, while he was helping to treat patients in the Anyox Hospital. Dozens of workers and residents of Anyox died from the flu epidemic.\n\nIn the early 1920s, the concrete pioneer and dam engineer [[John S. Eastwood]] designed a [[hydroelectric]] dam, which,  at {{convert|156|ft|m|0}} high, was the tallest dam in Canada for many years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://library.ucr.edu/wrca/collections/portraits/eastwood.html |publisher=[[Water Resources Collections and Archives]] |title=John Samuel Eastwood, 1857-1924 (Archived copy) |accessdate=2018-09-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120602003042/http://library.ucr.edu/wrca/collections/portraits/eastwood.html |archivedate=2012-06-02}}</ref>  Anyox was almost wiped out by forest fires in 1923, but the townsite was rebuilt, and mining operations continued. [[Acid rain]] from the smelter denuded the trees from the hillsides, which soon became bare.\n\nThe [[Great Depression]] drove down the demand for copper, which was effectively the beginning of the end for Anyox. Operations continued but were steadily scaled down while the company stockpiled {{convert|100000000|lb|tonne|abbr=off}} of copper, three years of production, which it was unable to sell.<ref name=Relics/> The mine shut down in 1935, and the town was abandoned. Salvage operations in the 1940s removed most machinery and steel from the town, and two forest fires, in 1942 and 1943, burned all of the remaining wood structures.<ref name=Relics/><ref name=Northword>{{cite news |url=http://northword.ca/features/the-paradox-of-anyox-new-hope-springs-from-old-mine-site |title=The Paradox of Anyox—New hope springs from old mine site |first=Joanne |last=Campbell |work=Northword Magazine |date=2015-03-27 |accessdate=2018-09-15}}</ref>\n\nDuring its 25 year existence, Anyox's mines and smelters produced {{convert|140000|oz|tonne|0|abbr=off}} of gold, {{convert|8000000|oz|tonne|abbr=off}} of silver and {{convert|760000000|lb|tonne|abbr=off}} of copper.<ref name=Relics/>\n\n==Ongoing developments==\nActive mineral exploration continues in the area. In the 1980s, local entrepreneurs teamed with Vancouver investors to purchase the long dormant operations from the owner of record.<ref name=Northword/> Whenever there is a rise in the price of copper, there is speculation about the possibility of re-development, but none has ever occurred.\n\nSince 2000, the current owners have been trying to attract interest in rehabilitating the hydroelectric dam to supply the British Columbia grid or to attract and serve an on-site [[liquefied natural gas|natural gas liquefaction]] facility.<ref name=Northword/>\n\nThe town was the subject of the 2022 documentary film ''[[Anyox (film)|Anyox]]''.<ref>Marc van de Klashorst, [https://icsfilm.org/festivals/cinema-du-reel/cinema-du-reel-2022-review-anyox-jessica-johnson-ryan-ermacora/ \"Cinéma du Réel 2022 review: Anyox (Jessica Johnson & Ryan Ermacora)\"].

For example, in 1678, he traveled the distance in 3 months and 4 (or 10) days, delivering governor [[Rijckloff van Goens]] a stack of letters from which the traveling time could be confirmed.
