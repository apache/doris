/// LruMultiCache is a threadsafe Least Recently Used Cache built on std::unordered_map
/// and boost::intrusive::list
///
/// Features
///   - can store multiple objects with the same key
///   - provides unique access to the freshest available stored object
///   - soft capacity to limit stored objects
///   - EvictOlderThan() function to age out unused objects
///   - O(1) operations (except EvictOlderThan(), which can trigger multiple evictions)
///   - automatic release of objects with RAII accessor
///   - explicit release/destroy through accessor
///   - prevents aging by removing empty owning lists
///
/// Limitations
///   - User has to guarantee the cache outlives the accessors
///   - The cache can't force the capacity limit, it can overshoot in case all the objects
///   are in use and we emplace more than the capacity, releases will evict the objects in
///   this case
///   - A bit heavy weight for simple usage (e.g. no thread safety, no unique access, no
///   multi storage, no timestamp based eviction), it was designed to store
///   HdfsFileHandles
///   - Only emplace of objects are supported and it locks the cache during construction.
///   - Inefficient memory cache usage
///

///   Cache
///     - std::unordered_map stores std::list of the objects extended with internal
///     information, these lists are the owners
///     - Owning lists are maintaining LRU order only for available objects (order does
///     not matter for currently used objects) to support O(1) get, the least recently
///     used, currently available element is at the front of the list, if there is one
///     - boost::intrusive::list maintains an LRU list of the currently available objects,
///     this is an intrusive (as known as not owning) list, used for eviction

///   Accessor
///     - RAII object which provides unique access to and object and releases
