/** Hash functions that are better than the trivial function std::hash.
  *
  * Example: when we do aggregation by the visitor ID, the performance increase is more than 5 times.
  * This is because of following reasons:
  * - in Yandex, visitor identifier is an integer that has timestamp with seconds resolution in lower bits;
  * - in typical implementation of standard library, hash function for integers is trivial and just use lower bits;
  * - traffic is non-uniformly distributed across a day;
  * - we are using open-addressing linear probing hash tables that are most critical to hash function quality,
  *   and trivial hash function gives disastrous results.

/** A relatively good non-cryptographic hash function from UInt64 to UInt32.
  * But worse (both in quality and speed) than just cutting int_hash64.
  * Taken from here: http://www.concentric.net/~ttwang/tech/inthash.htm
  *
  * Slightly changed compared to the function by link: shifts to the right are accidentally replaced by a cyclic shift to the right.
  * This change did not affect the smhasher test results.
  *
  * It is recommended to use different salt for different tasks.
  * That was the case that in the database values were sorted by hash (for low-quality pseudo-random spread),
  *  and in another place, in the aggregate function, the same hash was used in the hash table,
  *  as a result, this aggregate function was monstrously slowed due to collisions.
  *
  * NOTE Salting is far from perfect, because it commutes with first steps of calculation.
  *
  * NOTE As mentioned, this function is slower than int_hash64.
  * But occasionally, it is faster, when written in a loop and loop is vectorized.
