// This file provides a few functions for hashing strings.  On x86-64
// hardware as of early 2010, CityHash64() is much faster than
// MurmurHash64(), and passes the quality-of-hash tests in
// ./hasheval/hasheval_test.cc, among others, with flying colors.  The
// difference in speed can be a factor of two for strings of 50 to 64
// bytes, and sometimes even more for cache-resident longer strings.
//
// CityHash128() is optimized for relatively long strings and returns
// a 128-bit hash.  For strings more than about 2000 bytes it can be
// faster than CityHash64().
//
// Functions in the CityHash family are not suitable for cryptography.
//
// By the way, for some hash functions, given strings a and b, the hash
// of a+b is easily derived from the hashes of a and b.  This property
// doesn't hold for any hash functions in this file.
