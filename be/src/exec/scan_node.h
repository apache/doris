// Abstract base class of all scan nodes; introduces set_scan_range().
//
// Includes ScanNode common counters:
//   BytesRead - total bytes read by this scan node
//
//   TotalRawHdfsReadTime - it measures the total time spent in the disk-io-mgr's reading
//     threads for this node. For example, if we have 3 reading threads and each spent
//     1 sec, this counter will report 3 sec.
//
//   TotalReadThroughput - BytesRead divided by the total time spent in this node
//     (from Open to Close). For IO bounded queries, this should be very close to the
//     total throughput of all the disks.
//
//   PerDiskRawHdfsThroughput - the read throughput for each disk. If all the data reside
//     on disk, this should be the read throughput the disk, regardless of whether the
//     query is IO bounded or not.
//
//   NumDisksAccessed - number of disks accessed.
//
//   AverageIoMgrQueueCapcity - the average queue capacity in the io mgr for this node.
//   AverageIoMgrQueueSize - the average queue size (for ready buffers) in the io mgr
//     for this node.
//
//   AverageScannerThreadConcurrency - the average number of active scanner threads. A
//     scanner thread is considered active if it is not blocked by IO. This number would
//     be low (less than 1) for IO bounded queries. For cpu bounded queries, this number
//     would be close to the max scanner threads allowed.
//
//   AverageHdfsReadThreadConcurrency - the average number of active hdfs reading threads
//     reading for this scan node. For IO bound queries, this should be close to the
//     number of disk.
//
//     HdfsReadThreadConcurrencyCount=<i> - the number of samples taken when the hdfs read
//       thread concurrency is <i>.
//
//   ScanRangesComplete - number of scan ranges completed
//
