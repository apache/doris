    This class is used to control compaction permission. To some extent, it can be used to control memory consumption.

    compaction tasks reaches a threshold, subsequent compaction task will be no longer allowed, until some "permits"
    are released by some finished compaction tasks. "compaction score" for tablet is used as "permits" here.
