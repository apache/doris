// Controls when to pre-flush a block. Valid values are 'finalize',
// 'close', or 'never'.
// + If 'finalize', blocks will be pre-flushed when writing is finished.
// + If 'close', blocks will be pre-flushed when their transaction is committed.
// + If 'never', blocks will never be pre-flushed but still be flushed when closed.");
//
// The default value is optimized for throughput in the case that
// there are multiple drives backing the tablet. By asynchronously
// flushing each block before issuing any fsyncs, the IO across
// disks is done in parallel.
//
// This increases throughput but can harm latency in the case that
// there are few disks and the WAL is on the same disk as the
// data blocks. The default is chosen based on the assumptions that:
// - latency is leveled across machines by Raft
// - latency-sensitive applications can devote a disk to the WAL
// - super-sensitive applications can devote an SSD to the WAL.
// - users could always change this to "never", which slows down
//   throughput but may improve write latency.
//
// TODO(lingbin): move it to conf later, to allow adjust dynamicaly.
