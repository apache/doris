/// with AddFreeBuffer(). If the list is non-empty, calling PopFreeBuffer() will return
/// one of the buffers previously added to the list. FreeList is agnostic about the size
/// or other properties of the buffers added to it.
///
/// Buffers in the list can be freed at any point, e.g. if the list is storing too many
/// free buffers (according to some policy). The caller is responsible for implementing
/// the policy and calling FreeBuffers() or FreeAll() at the appropriate times.
///
/// Address space fragmentation
/// ---------------------------
/// To reduce memory fragmentation, the free list hands out buffers with lower memory
/// addresses first and frees buffers with higher memory address first. If buffers were
/// handed out by a policy that didn't take memory address into account, over time the
/// distribution of free buffers within the address space would become essentially
/// random. If free buffers were then unmapped, there would be many holes in the virtual
/// memory map, which can cause difficulties for the OS in some cases, e.g. exceeding the
/// maximum number of mmapped() regions (vm.max_map_count) in Linux. Using this approach
/// will tend to consolidate free buffers in higher parts of the address space, allowing
/// coalescing of the holes in most cases.
