/// The internal buffer allocator used by BufferPool to allocator power-of-two sized
/// buffers. BufferAllocator builds on top of SystemAllocator by adding caching of
/// free buffers and clean pages where the memory is not currently in use by a client
/// but has not yet been released to SystemAllocator.
///
/// The allocator is optimised for the common case where an allocation can be served
/// by reclaiming a buffer of the request size from the current core's arena. In this
/// case there is no contention for locks between concurrently-running threads. If this
/// fails, progressively more expensive approaches to allocate memory are tried until
/// the allocation eventually success (see AllocateInternal() for details).
///
/// Buffer Reservations
/// ===================
/// The implementation of the BufferAllocator relies on the BufferPool's reservation
/// tracking system. The allocator is given a hard limit ('system_bytes_limit'), above
/// which all allocations will fail. Allocations up to 'system_bytes_limit' are
/// guaranteed to succeed unless an unexpected system error occurs (e.g. we can't allocate
/// all of the required memory from the OS). Reservations must be set up so that the total
/// of all reservations does not exceed 'system_bytes_limit', thus ensuring that
/// BufferAllocator can always find memory to fulfill reservations.
///
/// +========================+
/// | IMPLEMENTATION NOTES   |
/// +========================+
///
/// Memory
/// ======
/// Memory managed by BufferAllocator comes in four forms:
/// 1. Buffers returned to the client (corresponding to a used reservation)
/// 2. Free buffers cached in the BufferAllocator's free lists.
/// 3. Buffers attached to clean unpinned pages in the BufferAllocator's clean page lists.
/// 4. Bytes that are not allocated from the system: 'system_bytes_remaining_'.
/// Together these always add up to 'system_bytes_limit', which allows BufferAllocator
/// to always fulfill reservations via some combination of memory in forms 2, 3 or 4.
///
/// The BufferAllocator code is careful not to make memory inaccessible to concurrently
/// executing threads that are entitled to it. E.g. if one thread is entitled to allocate
/// a 1MB buffer from the BufferAllocator's free or clean page lists but needs to release
/// a 2MB buffer to the system to free up enough memory, it must add 1MB to
/// 'system_bytes_remaining_' in the same critical section in which it freed the 2MB
/// buffer. Otherwise a concurrent thread that had a reservation for 1MB of memory might
/// not be able to find it.
///
/// Arenas
/// ======
/// The buffer allocator's data structures are broken up into arenas, with an arena per
/// core. Within each arena, each buffer or page is stored in a list with buffers and
/// pages of the same size: there is a separate list for every power-of-two size. Each
/// arena is protected by a separate lock, so in the common case where threads are able
/// to fulfill allocations from their own arena, there will be no lock contention.
///
