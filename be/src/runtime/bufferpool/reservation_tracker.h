/// A tracker for a hierarchy of buffer pool memory reservations, denominated in bytes.
/// A hierarchy of ReservationTrackers provides a mechanism for subdividing buffer pool
/// memory and enforcing upper and lower bounds on memory usage.
///
/// The root of the tracker tree enforces a global maximum, which is distributed among its
/// children. Each tracker in the tree has a 'reservation': the total bytes of buffer pool
/// memory it is entitled to use. The reservation is inclusive of any memory that is
/// already allocated from the reservation, i.e. using a reservation to allocate memory
/// does not subtract from the reservation.
///
/// A reservation can be used directly at the tracker by calling AllocateFrom(), or
/// distributed to children of the tracker for the childrens' reservations. Each tracker
/// in the tree can use up to its reservation without checking parent trackers. To
/// increase its reservation, a tracker must use some of its parent's reservation (and
/// perhaps increase reservations all the way to the root of the tree).
///
/// Each tracker also has a maximum reservation that is enforced. E.g. if the root of the
/// tracker hierarchy is the global tracker for the Impala daemon and the next level of
/// the hierarchy is made up of per-query trackers, then the maximum reservation
/// mechanism can enforce both process-level and query-level limits on reservations.
///
/// Invariants:
/// * A tracker's reservation is at most its reservation limit: reservation <= limit
/// * A tracker's reservation is at least the sum of its childrens' reservations plus
///   the amount of the reservation used directly at this tracker. The difference is
///   the unused reservation:
///     child_reservations + used_reservation + unused_reservation = reservation.
///
/// Thread-safety:
/// All public ReservationTracker methods are thread-safe. If multiple threads
/// concurrently invoke methods on a ReservationTracker, each operation is applied
/// atomically to leave the ReservationTracker in a consistent state. Calling threads
/// are responsible for coordinating to avoid violating any method preconditions,
/// e.g. ensuring that there is sufficient unused reservation before calling AllocateTo().
///
/// Integration with MemTracker hierarchy:
/// TODO: we will remove MemTracker and this integration once all memory is accounted via
/// reservations.
///
/// Each ReservationTracker can optionally have a linked MemTracker. E.g. an exec
/// node's ReservationTracker can be linked with the exec node's MemTracker, so that
/// reservations are included in query memory consumption for the purposes of enforcing
/// memory limits, reporting and logging. The reservation is accounted as consumption
/// against the linked MemTracker and its ancestors because reserved memory is committed.
/// Allocating from a reservation therefore does not change the consumption reflected in
/// the MemTracker hierarchy.
///
/// MemTracker limits are only checked via the topmost link (i.e. the query-level
/// trackers): we require that no MemTrackers below this level have limits.
///
/// We require that the MemTracker hierarchy is consistent with the ReservationTracker
/// hierarchy. I.e. if a ReservationTracker is linked to a MemTracker "A", and its parent
/// is linked to a MemTracker "B", then "B" must be the parent of "A"'.
