// SpillSorter contains the external sort implementation. Its purpose is to sort arbitrarily
// large input data sets with a fixed memory budget by spilling data to disk if
// necessary. BufferedBlockMgr2 is used to allocate and manage blocks of data to be
// sorted.
//
// The client API for SpillSorter is as follows:
// add_batch() is used to add input rows to be sorted. Multiple tuples in an input row are
// materialized into a row with a single tuple (the sort tuple) using the materialization
// exprs in _sort_tuple_slot_expr_ctxs. The sort tuples are sorted according to the sort
// parameters and output by the sorter.
// add_batch() can be called multiple times.
//
// input_done() is called to indicate the end of input. If multiple sorted runs were
// created, it triggers intermediate merge steps (if necessary) and creates the final
// merger that returns results via get_next().
//
// get_next() is used to retrieve sorted rows. It can be called multiple times.
// add_batch(), input_done() and get_next() must be called in that order.
//
// Batches of input rows are collected into a sequence of pinned BufferedBlockMgr2 blocks
// called a run. The maximum size of a run is determined by the maximum available buffers
// in the block manager. After the run is full, it is sorted in memory, unpinned and the
// next run is collected.  The variable-length column data (e.g. string slots) in the
// materialized sort tuples are stored in separate sequence of blocks from the tuples
// themselves.
// When the blocks containing tuples in a run are unpinned, the var-len slot pointers are
// converted to offsets from the start of the first var-len data block. When a block is
// read back, these offsets are converted back to pointers.
// The in-memory sorter sorts the fixed-length tuples in-place. The output rows have the
// same schema as the materialized sort tuples.
//
// After the input is consumed, the sorter is left with one or more sorted runs. The
// client calls get_next(output_batch) to retrieve batches of sorted rows. If there are
// multiple runs, the runs are merged using SortedRunMerger to produce a stream of sorted
// tuples. At least one block per run (two if there are var-length slots) must be pinned
// in memory during a merge, so multiple merges may be necessary if the number of runs is
// too large. During a merge, rows from multiple sorted input runs are compared and copied
// into a single larger run. One input batch is created to hold tuple rows for each
// input run, and one batch is created to hold deep copied rows (i.e. ptrs + data) from
// the output of the merge.
//
// If there is a single sorted run (i.e. no merge required), only tuple rows are
// copied into the output batch supplied by get_next, and the data itself is left in
// pinned blocks held by the sorter.
//
// Note that init() must be called right after the constructor.
//
// During a merge, one row batch is created for each input run, and one batch is created
// for the output of the merge (if is not the final merge). It is assumed that the memory
// for these batches have already been accounted for in the memory budget for the sort.
// That is, the memory for these batches does not come out of the block buffer manager.
//
// TODO: Not necessary to actually copy var-len data - instead take ownership of the
// var-length data in the input batch. Copying can be deferred until a run is unpinned.
// TODO: When the first run is constructed, create a sequence of pointers to materialized
// tuples. If the input fits in memory, the pointers can be sorted instead of sorting the
// tuples in place.
