// PlanFragmentExecutor handles all aspects of the execution of a single plan fragment,
// including setup and tear-down, both in the success and error case.
// Tear-down frees all memory allocated for this plan fragment and closes all data
// streams; it happens automatically in the d'tor.
//
// The executor makes an aggregated profile for the entire fragment available,
// which includes profile information for the plan itself as well as the output
// sink, if any.
// The ReportStatusCallback passed into the c'tor is invoked periodically to report the
// execution status. The frequency of those reports is controlled by the flag
// status_report_interval; setting that flag to 0 disables periodic reporting altogether
// Regardless of the value of that flag, if a report callback is specified, it is
// invoked at least once at the end of execution with an overall status and profile
// (and 'done' indicator). The only exception is when execution is cancelled, in which
// case the callback is *not* invoked (the coordinator already knows that execution
// stopped, because it initiated the cancellation).
//
// Aside from Cancel(), which may be called asynchronously, this class is not
// thread-safe.
