// Internal per request-context state. This object maintains a lot of state that is
// carefully synchronized. The context maintains state across all disks as well as
// per disk state.
// The unit for an IO request is a RequestRange, which may be a ScanRange or a
// WriteRange.
// A scan range for the reader is on one of five states:
// 1) PerDiskState's unstarted_ranges: This range has only been queued
//    and nothing has been read from it.
// 2) RequestContext's _ready_to_start_ranges: This range is about to be started.
//    As soon as the reader picks it up, it will move to the in_flight_ranges
//    queue.
// 3) PerDiskState's in_flight_ranges: This range is being processed and will
//    be read from the next time a disk thread picks it up in get_next_request_range()
// 4) ScanRange's outgoing ready buffers is full. We can't read for this range
//    anymore. We need the caller to pull a buffer off which will put this in
//    the in_flight_ranges queue. These ranges are in the RequestContext's
//    _blocked_ranges queue.
// 5) ScanRange is cached and in the _cached_ranges queue.
//
// If the scan range is read and does not get blocked on the outgoing queue, the
// transitions are: 1 -> 2 -> 3.
// If the scan range does get blocked, the transitions are
// 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> (4 -> 3)*
//
// In the case of a cached scan range, the range is immediately put in _cached_ranges.
// When the caller asks for the next range to process, we first pull ranges from
// the _cache_ranges queue. If the range was cached, the range is removed and
// done (ranges are either entirely cached or not at all). If the cached read attempt
// fails, we put the range in state 1.
//
// A write range for a context may be in one of two lists:
// 1) _unstarted_write_ranges : Ranges that have been queued but not processed.
// 2) _in_flight_ranges: The write range is ready to be processed by the next disk thread
//    that picks it up in get_next_request_range().
//
// AddWriteRange() adds WriteRanges for a disk.
// It is the responsibility of the client to pin the data to be written via a WriteRange
// in memory. After a WriteRange has been written, a callback is invoked to inform the
// client that the write has completed.
//
// An important assumption is that write does not exceed the maximum read size and that
// the entire range is written when the write request is handled. (In other words, writes
// are not broken up.)
//
// When a RequestContext is processed by a disk thread in get_next_request_range(), a write
// range is always removed from the list of unstarted write ranges and appended to the
// _in_flight_ranges queue. This is done to alternate reads and writes - a read that is
// scheduled (by calling GetNextRange()) is always followed by a write (if one exists).
// And since at most one WriteRange can be present in _in_flight_ranges at any time
// (once a write range is returned from GetNetxRequestRange() it is completed and not
// re-enqueued), a scan range scheduled via a call to GetNextRange() can be queued up
// behind at most one write range.
