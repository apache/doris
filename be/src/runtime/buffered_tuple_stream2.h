// Class that provides an abstraction for a stream of tuple rows. Rows can be
// added to the stream and returned. Rows are returned in the order they are added.
//
// The underlying memory management is done by the BufferedBlockMgr2.
//
// The tuple stream consists of a number of small (less than IO-sized blocks) before
// an arbitrary number of IO-sized blocks. The smaller blocks do not spill and are
// there to lower the minimum buffering requirements. For example, an operator that
// needs to maintain 64 streams (1 buffer per partition) would need, by default,
// 64 * 8MB = 512MB of buffering. A query with 5 of these operators would require
// 2.56GB just to run, regardless of how much of that is used. This is
// problematic for small queries. Instead we will start with a fixed number of small
// buffers (currently 2 small buffers: one 64KB and one 512KB) and only start using IO
// sized buffers when those fill up. The small buffers never spill.
// The stream will *not* automatically switch from using small buffers to IO-sized
// buffers when all the small buffers for this stream have been used.
//
// The BufferedTupleStream2 is *not* thread safe from the caller's point of view. It is
// expected that all the APIs are called from a single thread. Internally, the
// object is thread safe wrt to the underlying block mgr.
//
// Buffer management:
// The stream is either pinned or unpinned, set via pin_stream() and unpin_stream().
// Blocks are optionally deleted as they are read, set with the delete_on_read argument
// to prepare_for_read().
//
// Block layout:
// At the header of each block, starting at position 0, there is a bitstring with null
// indicators for all the tuples in each row in the block. Then there are the tuple rows.
// We further optimize the codepaths when we know that no tuple is nullable, indicated
// by '_nullable_tuple'.
//
// Tuple row layout:
// Tuples are stored back to back. Each tuple starts with the fixed length portion,
// directly followed by the var len portion. (Fixed len and var len are interleaved).
// If any tuple in the row is nullable, then there is a bitstring of null tuple
// indicators at the header of the block. The order of bits in the null indicators
// bitstring corresponds to the order of tuples in the block. The NULL tuples are not
// stored in the body of the block, only as set bits in the null indicators bitsting.
//
// The behavior of reads and writes is as follows:
// Read:
//   1. Delete on read (_delete_on_read): Blocks are deleted as we go through the stream.
//   The data returned by the tuple stream is valid until the next read call so the
//   caller does not need to copy if it is streaming.
//   2. Unpinned: Blocks remain in _blocks and are unpinned after reading.
//   3. Pinned: Blocks remain in _blocks and are left pinned after reading. If the next
//   block in the stream cannot be pinned, the read call will fail and the caller needs
//   to free memory from the underlying block mgr.
// Write:
//   1. Unpinned: Unpin blocks as they fill up. This means only a single (i.e. the
//   current) block needs to be in memory regardless of the input size (if read_write is
//   true, then two blocks need to be in memory).
//   2. Pinned: Blocks are left pinned. If we run out of blocks, the write will fail and
//   the caller needs to free memory from the underlying block mgr.
//
// TODO: we need to be able to do read ahead in the BufferedBlockMgr2. It currently
// only has PinAllBlocks() which is blocking. We need a non-blocking version of this or
// some way to indicate a block will need to be pinned soon.
// TODO: see if this can be merged with Sorter::Run. The key difference is that this
// does not need to return rows in the order they were added, which allows it to be
// simpler.
// TODO: we could compact the small buffers when we need to spill but they use very
// little memory so ths might not be very useful.
// TODO: improvements:
//   - Think about how to layout for the var len data more, possibly filling in them
//     from the end of the same block. Don't interleave fixed and var len data.
//   - It would be good to allocate the null indicators at the end of each block and grow
//     this array as new rows are inserted in the block. If we do so, then there will be
//     fewer gaps in case of many rows with NULL tuples.
//   - We will want to multithread this. Add a AddBlock() call so the synchronization
//     happens at the block level. This is a natural extension.
//   - Instead of allocating all blocks from the block_mgr, allocate some blocks that
//     are much smaller (e.g. 16K and doubling up to the block size). This way, very
//     small streams (a common case) will use very little memory. This small blocks
//     are always in memory since spilling them frees up negligible memory.
//   - Return row batches in get_next() instead of filling one in
//   - Should we 32-bit align the start of the tuple rows? Now it is byte-aligned.
