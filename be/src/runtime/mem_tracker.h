/// A MemTracker tracks memory consumption; it contains an optional limit
/// and can be arranged into a tree structure such that the consumption tracked
/// by a MemTracker is also tracked by its ancestors.
///
/// A MemTracker has a hard and a soft limit derived from the limit. If the hard limit
/// is exceeded, all memory allocations and queries should fail until we are under the
/// limit again. The soft limit can be exceeded without causing query failures, but
/// consumers of memory that can tolerate running without more memory should not allocate
/// memory in excess of the soft limit.
///
/// We use a five-level hierarchy of mem trackers: process, pool, query, fragment
/// instance. Specific parts of the fragment (exec nodes, sinks, etc) will add a
/// fifth level when they are initialized. This function also initializes a user
/// function mem tracker (in the fifth level).
///
/// By default, memory consumption is tracked via calls to Consume()/Release(), either to
/// the tracker itself or to one of its descendents. Alternatively, a consumption metric
/// can be specified, and then the metric's value is used as the consumption rather than
/// the tally maintained by Consume() and Release(). A tcmalloc metric is used to track
/// process memory consumption, since the process memory usage may be higher than the
/// computed total memory (tcmalloc does not release deallocated memory immediately).
/// Other consumption metrics are used in trackers below the process level to account
/// for memory (such as free buffer pool buffers) that is not tracked by Consume() and
/// Release().
///
/// GcFunctions can be attached to a MemTracker in order to free up memory if the limit is
/// reached. If LimitExceeded() is called and the limit is exceeded, it will first call
/// the GcFunctions to try to free memory and recheck the limit. For example, the process
/// tracker has a GcFunction that releases any unused memory still held by tcmalloc, so
/// this will be called before the process limit is reported as exceeded. GcFunctions are
/// called in the order they are added, so expensive functions should be added last.
/// GcFunctions are called with a global lock held, so should be non-blocking and not
/// call back into MemTrackers, except to release memory.
//
