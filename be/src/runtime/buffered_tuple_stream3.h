/// Class that provides an abstraction for a stream of tuple rows backed by BufferPool
/// Pages. Rows can be added to the stream and read back. Rows are returned in the order
/// they are added.
///
/// The BufferedTupleStream3 is *not* thread safe from the caller's point of view.
/// Different threads should not concurrently call methods of the same BufferedTupleStream3
/// object.
///
/// Reading and writing the stream:
/// The stream supports two modes of reading/writing, depending on whether
/// PrepareForWrite() is called to initialize a write iterator only or
/// PrepareForReadWrite() is called to initialize both read and write iterators to enable
/// interleaved reads and writes.
///
/// To use write-only mode, PrepareForWrite() is called once and AddRow()/AddRowCustom*()
/// are called repeatedly to initialize then advance a write iterator through the stream.
/// Once the stream is fully written, it can be read back by calling PrepareForRead()
/// then GetNext() repeatedly to advance a read iterator through the stream, or by
/// calling GetRows() to get all of the rows at once.
///
/// To use read/write mode, PrepareForReadWrite() is called once to initialize the read
/// and write iterators. AddRow()/AddRowCustom*() then advance a write iterator through
/// the stream, and GetNext() advances a trailing read iterator through the stream.
///
/// Buffer management:
/// The tuple stream is backed by a sequence of BufferPool Pages. The tuple stream uses
/// the client's reservation to pin pages in memory. It will automatically try to
/// increase the client's reservation whenever it needs to do so to make progress.
///
/// Normally pages are all of the same default page length, but larger pages up to the
/// max page length are used if needed to store rows that are too large for a
/// default-length page.
///
/// The stream has both pinned and unpinned modes. In the pinned mode all pages are
/// pinned for reading. The pinned mode avoids I/O by keeping all pages pinned in memory
/// and allows clients to save pointers to rows in the stream and randomly access them.
/// E.g. hash tables can be backed by a BufferedTupleStream3. In the unpinned mode, only
/// pages currently being read and written are pinned and other pages are unpinned and
/// therefore do not use the client's reservation and can be spilled to disk. The stream
/// always holds onto a default page's worth of reservation for the read and write
/// iterators (i.e. two page's worth if the stream is in read/write mode), even if that
/// many pages are not currently pinned. This means that UnpinStream() always succeeds,
/// and moving to the next default-length write page or read page on an unpinned stream
/// does not require additional reservation. This is implemented by saving reservations
/// in SubReservations.
///
/// To read or write a row larger than the default page size to/from an unpinned stream,
/// the client must have max_page_len - default_page_len unused reservation. Writing a
/// large row to an unpinned stream only uses the reservation for the duration of the
/// AddRow()/AddRowCustom*() call. Reading a large row from an unpinned stream uses the
/// reservation until the next call to GetNext(). E.g. to partition a single unpinned
/// stream into n unpinned streams, the reservation needed is (n - 1) *
/// default_page_len + 2 * max_page_len: one large read buffer and one large write
/// buffer is needed to keep the row being processed in-memory, but only default-sized
/// buffers are needed for the other streams being written.
///
/// The tuple stream also supports a 'delete_on_read' mode, enabled by passing a flag
/// to PrepareForRead() which deletes the stream's pages as it does a final read
/// pass over the stream.
///
/// TODO: IMPALA-4179: the buffer management can be simplified once we can attach
/// buffers to RowBatches.
///
/// Page layout:
/// Rows are stored back to back starting at the first byte of each page's buffer, with
/// no interleaving of data from different rows. There is no padding or alignment
/// between rows. Rows larger than the default page length are stored on their own
/// page.
///
/// Tuple row layout:
/// If the stream's tuples are nullable (i.e. has_nullable_tuple_ is true), there is a
/// bitstring at the start of each row with null indicators for all tuples in each row
/// (including non-nullable tuples). The bitstring occupies ceil(num_tuples_per_row / 8)
/// bytes. A 1 indicates the tuple is null.
///
/// The fixed length parts of the row's tuples are stored first, followed by var len data
/// for inlined_string_slots_ and inlined_coll_slots_. Other "external" var len slots can
/// point to var len data outside the stream. When reading the stream, the length of each
/// row's var len data in the stream must be computed to find the next row's start.
///
/// The tuple stream supports reading from the stream into RowBatches without copying
/// out any data: the RowBatches' Tuple pointers will point directly into the stream's
/// pages' buffers. The fixed length parts follow Impala's internal tuple format, so for
/// the tuple to be valid, we only need to update pointers to point to the var len data
/// in the stream. These pointers need to be updated by the stream because a spilled
/// page's data may be relocated to a different buffer. The pointers are updated lazily
/// upon reading the stream via GetNext() or GetRows().
///
/// Example layout for a row with two non-nullable tuples ((1, "hello"), (2, "world"))
/// with all var len data stored in the stream:
///  <---- tuple 1 -----> <------ tuple 2 ------> <- var len -> <- next row ...
/// +--------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-------------+
/// | IntVal | StringVal | BigIntVal | StringVal |             | ...

/// with all var len data stored in the stream:

/// The behavior of reads and writes is as follows:
/// Read:
///   1. Unpinned: Only a single read page is pinned at a time. This means that only
///     enough reservation to pin a single page is needed to read the stream, regardless
///     of the stream's size. Each page is deleted or unpinned (if delete on read is true
///     or false respectively) before advancing to the next page.
///   2. Pinned: All pages in the stream are pinned so do not need to be pinned or
///     unpinned when reading from the stream. If delete on read is true, pages are
///     deleted after being read. If the stream was previously unpinned, the page's data
///     may not yet be in memory - reading from the stream can block on I/O or fail with
///     an I/O error.
/// Write:
///   1. Unpinned: Unpin pages as they fill up. This means that only a enough reservation
///     to pin a single write page is required to write to the stream, regardless of the
///     stream's size.
///   2. Pinned: Pages are left pinned. If the next page in the stream cannot be pinned
///     because the client's reservation is insufficient (and could not be increased by
///     the stream), the read call will fail and the client can either unpin the stream
///     or free up other memory before retrying.
///
/// Memory lifetime of rows read from stream:
/// If the stream is pinned and delete on read is false, it is valid to access any tuples
/// returned via GetNext() or GetRows() until the stream is unpinned. If the stream is
/// unpinned or delete on read is true, then the batch returned from GetNext() may have
/// the needs_deep_copy flag set, which means that any tuple memory returned so far from
/// the stream may be freed on the next call to GetNext().
/// TODO: IMPALA-4179, instead of needs_deep_copy, attach the pages' buffers to the batch.
///
/// Manual construction of rows with AddRowCustomBegin()/AddRowCustomEnd():
/// The BufferedTupleStream3 supports allocation of uninitialized rows with
/// AddRowCustom*(). AddRowCustomBegin() is called instead of AddRow() if the client wants
/// to manually construct a row. The caller of AddRowCustomBegin() is responsible for
/// writing the row with exactly the layout described above then calling
/// AddRowCustomEnd() when done.
///
/// If a caller constructs a tuple in this way, the caller can set the pointers and they
/// will not be modified until the stream is read via GetNext() or GetRows().
/// TODO: IMPALA-5007: try to remove AddRowCustom*() by unifying with AddRow().
