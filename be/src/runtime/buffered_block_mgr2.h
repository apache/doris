// The BufferedBlockMgr2 is used to allocate and manage blocks of data using a fixed memory
// budget. Available memory is split into a pool of fixed-size memory buffers. When a
// client allocates or requests a block, the block is assigned a buffer from this pool and
// is 'pinned' in memory. Clients can also unpin a block, allowing the manager to reassign
// its buffer to a different block.
//
// The BufferedBlockMgr2 typically allocates blocks in IO buffer size to get maximal IO
// efficiency when spilling. Clients can also request smaller buffers that cannot spill
// (note that it would be possible to spill small buffers, but we currently do not allow
// it). This is useful to present the same block API and mem tracking for clients (one can
// use the block mgr API to mem track non-spillable (smaller) buffers). Clients that do
// partitioning (e.g. PHJ and PAGG) will start with these smaller buffer sizes to reduce
// the minimum buffering requirements and grow to max sized buffers as the input grows.
// For simplicity, these small buffers are not recycled (there's also not really a need
// since they are allocated all at once on query startup). These buffers are not counted
// against the reservation.
//
// The BufferedBlockMgr2 reserves one buffer per disk ('_block_write_threshold') for
// itself. When the number of free buffers falls below 'block_write_threshold', unpinned
// blocks are flushed in Last-In-First-Out order. (It is assumed that unpinned blocks are
// re-read in FIFO order). The TmpFileMgr is used to obtain file handles to write to
// within the tmp directories configured for Impala.
//
// It is expected to have one BufferedBlockMgr2 per query. All allocations that can grow
// proportional to the input size and that might need to spill to disk should allocate
// from the same BufferedBlockMgr2.
//
// A client must pin a block in memory to read/write its contents and unpin it when it is
// no longer in active use. The BufferedBlockMgr2 guarantees that:
//  a) The memory buffer assigned to a block is not removed or released while it is pinned.
//  b) The contents of an unpinned block will be available on a subsequent call to pin.
//
// The Client supports the following operations:
//  get_new_block(): Returns a new pinned block.
//  Close(): Frees all memory and disk space. Called when a query is closed or cancelled.
//   Close() is idempotent.
//
// A Block supports the following operations:
//  pin(): Pins a block to a buffer in memory, and reads its contents from disk if
//   necessary. If there are no free buffers, waits for a buffer to become available.
//   Invoked before the contents of a block are read or written. The block
//   will be maintained in memory until unpin() is called.
//  unpin(): Invoked to indicate the block is not in active use. The block is added to a
//   list of unpinned blocks. Unpinned blocks are only written when the number of free
//   blocks falls below the 'block_write_threshold'.
//  del(): Invoked to deallocate a block. The buffer associated with the block is
//   immediately released and its on-disk location (if any) reused.
//
// The block manager is thread-safe with the following caveat: A single block cannot be
// used simultaneously by multiple clients in any capacity.
// However, the block manager client is not thread-safe. That is, the block manager
// allows multiple single-threaded block manager clients.
//
/// TODO: When a block is read from disk, data is copied from the IOMgr buffer to the
/// block manager's buffer. This should be avoided in the common case where these buffers
/// are of the same size.
