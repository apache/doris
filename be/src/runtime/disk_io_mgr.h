class MemTracker;

// Manager object that schedules IO for all queries on all disks and remote filesystems
// (such as S3). Each query maps to one or more RequestContext objects, each of which
// has its own queue of scan ranges and/or write ranges.
//
// The API splits up requesting scan/write ranges (non-blocking) and reading the data
// (blocking). The DiskIoMgr has worker threads that will read from and write to
// disk/hdfs/remote-filesystems, allowing interleaving of IO and CPU. This allows us to
// keep all disks and all cores as busy as possible.
//
// All public APIs are thread-safe. It is not valid to call any of the APIs after
// unregister_context() returns.
//
// For Readers:
// We can model this problem as a multiple producer (threads for each disk), multiple
// consumer (scan ranges) problem. There are multiple queues that need to be
// synchronized. Conceptually, there are two queues:
//   1. The per disk queue: this contains a queue of readers that need reads.
//   2. The per scan range ready-buffer queue: this contains buffers that have been
//      read and are ready for the caller.
// The disk queue contains a queue of readers and is scheduled in a round robin fashion.
// Readers map to scan nodes. The reader then contains a queue of scan ranges. The caller
// asks the IoMgr for the next range to process. The IoMgr then selects the best range
// to read based on disk activity and begins reading and queuing buffers for that range.
// TODO: We should map readers to queries. A reader is the unit of scheduling and queries
// that have multiple scan nodes shouldn't have more 'turns'.
//
// For Writers:
// Data is written via add_write_range(). This is non-blocking and adds a WriteRange to a
// per-disk queue. After the write is complete, a callback in WriteRange is invoked.
// No memory is allocated within IoMgr for writes and no copies are made. It is the
// responsibility of the client to ensure that the data to be written is valid and that
// the file to be written to exists until the callback is invoked.
//
// The IoMgr provides three key APIs.
//  1. add_scan_ranges: this is non-blocking and tells the IoMgr all the ranges that
//     will eventually need to be read.
//  2. get_next_range: returns to the caller the next scan range it should process.
//     This is based on disk load. This also begins reading the data in this scan
//     range. This is blocking.
//  3. ScanRange::get_next: returns the next buffer for this range.  This is blocking.
//
// The disk threads do not synchronize with each other. The readers and writers don't
// synchronize with each other. There is a lock and condition variable for each request
// context queue and each disk queue.
// IMPORTANT: whenever both locks are needed, the lock order is to grab the context lock
// before the disk lock.
//
// Scheduling: If there are multiple request contexts with work for a single disk, the
// request contexts are scheduled in round-robin order. Multiple disk threads can
// operate on the same request context. Exactly one request range is processed by a
// disk thread at a time. If there are multiple scan ranges scheduled via
// get_next_range() for a single context, these are processed in round-robin order.
// If there are multiple scan and write ranges for a disk, a read is always followed
// by a write, and a write is followed by a read, i.e. reads and writes alternate.
// If multiple write ranges are enqueued for a single disk, they will be processed
// by the disk threads in order, but may complete in any order. No guarantees are made
// on ordering of writes across disks.
//
// Resource Management: effective resource management in the IoMgr is key to good
// performance. The IoMgr helps coordinate two resources: CPU and disk. For CPU,
// spinning up too many threads causes thrashing.
// Memory usage in the IoMgr comes from queued read buffers.  If we queue the minimum
// (i.e. 1), then the disks are idle while we are processing the buffer. If we don't
// limit the queue, then it possible we end up queueing the entire data set (i.e. CPU
// is slower than disks) and run out of memory.
// For both CPU and memory, we want to model the machine as having a fixed amount of
// resources.  If a single query is running, it should saturate either CPU or Disk
// as well as using as little memory as possible. With multiple queries, each query
// should get less CPU. In that case each query will need fewer queued buffers and
// therefore have less memory usage.
//
// The IoMgr defers CPU management to the caller. The IoMgr provides a get_next_range
// API which will return the next scan range the caller should process. The caller
// can call this from the desired number of reading threads. Once a scan range
// has been returned via get_next_range, the IoMgr will start to buffer reads for
// that range and it is expected the caller will pull those buffers promptly. For
// example, if the caller would like to have 1 scanner thread, the read loop
// would look like:
//   while (more_ranges)
//     range = get_next_range()
//     while (!range.eosr)
//       buffer = range.get_next()
// To have multiple reading threads, the caller would simply spin up the threads
// and each would process the loops above.
//
// To control the number of IO buffers, each scan range has a soft max capacity for
// the number of queued buffers. If the number of buffers is at capacity, the IoMgr
// will no longer read for that scan range until the caller has processed a buffer.
// This capacity does not need to be fixed, and the caller can dynamically adjust
// it if necessary.
//
// As an example: If we allowed 5 buffers per range on a 24 core, 72 thread
// (we default to allowing 3x threads) machine, we should see at most
// 72 * 5 * 8MB = 2.8GB in io buffers memory usage. This should remain roughly constant
// regardless of how many concurrent readers are running.
//
// Buffer Management:
// Buffers are allocated by the IoMgr as necessary to service reads. These buffers
// are directly returned to the caller. The caller must call Return() on the buffer
// when it is done, at which point the buffer will be recycled for another read. In error
// cases, the IoMgr will recycle the buffers more promptly but regardless, the caller
// must always call Return()
//
// Caching support:
// Scan ranges contain metadata on whether or not it is cached on the DN. In that
// case, we use the HDFS APIs to read the cached data without doing any copies. For these
// ranges, the reads happen on the caller thread (as opposed to the disk threads).
// It is possible for the cached read APIs to fail, in which case the ranges are then
// queued on the disk threads and behave identically to the case where the range
// is not cached.
// Resources for these ranges are also not accounted against the reader because none
// are consumed.
// While a cached block is being processed, the block is mlocked. We want to minimize
// the time the mlock is held.
//   - HDFS will time us out if we hold onto the mlock for too long
//   - Holding the lock prevents uncaching this file due to a caching policy change.
// Therefore, we only issue the cached read when the caller is ready to process the
// range (get_next_range()) instead of when the ranges are issued. This guarantees that
// there will be a CPU available to process the buffer and any throttling we do with
// the number of scanner threads properly controls the amount of files we mlock.
// With cached scan ranges, we cannot close the scan range until the cached buffer
// is returned (HDFS does not allow this). We therefore need to defer the close until
// the cached buffer is returned (BufferDescriptor::Return()).
//
// Remote filesystem support (e.g. S3):
// Remote filesystems are modeled as "remote disks". That is, there is a seperate disk
// queue for each supported remote filesystem type. In order to maximize throughput,
// multiple connections are opened in parallel by having multiple threads running per
// queue. Also note that reading from a remote filesystem service can be more CPU
// intensive than local disk/hdfs because of non-direct I/O and SSL processing, and can
// be CPU bottlenecked especially if not enough I/O threads for these queues are
// started.
//
// TODO: IoMgr should be able to request additional scan ranges from the coordinator
// to help deal with stragglers.
// TODO: look into using a lock free queue
// TODO: simplify the common path (less locking, memory allocations).
// TODO: Break this up the .h/.cc into multiple files under an /io subdirectory.
//
// Structure of the Implementation:
//  - All client APIs are defined in this file
