                             want them to be visible to just anyone. An importer must specify
                             the mandatory attribute for it to be able to import. See 
                             section #3.6.5 of OSGi R4 spec.
                             Why is this required?
                             See https://glassfish.dev.java.net/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=5385
                             By doing this, we allow user have any version of apache-commons lib
                             in their application class loader hierarchy. They don't even have to
                             set delegation=false in sun-web.xml! This is the true advantage of
                             using OSGi. Sahoo.
