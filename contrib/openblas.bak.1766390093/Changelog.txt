02-Dec-2018

common:
	* the new, experimental thread-local memory allocation had 
	  inadvertently been left enabled for gmake builds in 0.3.3

	* Externally set LDFLAGS are now passed through to the final compile/link
	  steps to facilitate setting platform-specific linker flags.
	* A potential race condition during the build of LAPACK (that would 
	  usually manifest itself as a failure to build TESTING/MATGEN) has been 
	  fixed.
	* xHEMV has been changed to stay single-threaded for small input sizes
	  where the overhead of multithreading exceeds any possible gains
	* CSWAP and ZSWAP have been limited to a single thread except on ARMV8 or
	  ThunderX hardware with sizable input.
	* Linker flags for the PGI compiler have been updated
	* Behaviour of AXPY with zero increments is now handled in the C interface,

	  hardware commonalities and model-specific compiler optimizations.
	* XGENE1 has been removed as a TARGET, superseded by the improved generic
	  ARMV8 support.
	
ARMV7:
	* Older assembly mnemonics have been converted to UAL form to allow
	  building with clang 7.0
	* Cross compiling LAPACKE for Android has been fixed again (broken by
	  update to LAPACK 3.7.0 some while ago).  
	  
====================================================================

31-Aug-2018

common:
	* thread memory allocation has been switched back to the method
	  used before version 0.3.1 due to unexpected problems caused by
	  the new code under some circumstances. A new compile-time option
	  USE_TLS has been added to enable the new code, and it is hoped
	  that this can become the default again in the next version.
	* LAPAck PR272 has been integrated, which fixes spurious errors
	  in DSYEVR and related functions caused by missing conversion
