    ./bin/build-ssb-dbgen.sh
### 2. generate ssb data. use -h for more infomations.
    ./bin/gen-ssb-data.sh -s 1
### 3. create ssb tables. modify `conf/doris-cluster.conf` to specify Doris cluster info, then run script below.
    ./bin/create-ssb-tables.sh
### 4. load ssb data. use -h for help.
    ./bin/load-ssb-data.sh
### 5. run ssb queries.
    ./bin/run-ssb-queries.sh

## ssb flat test, follow the steps below:
