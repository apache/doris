This tool is used to get the progress of all current table transitions 
during the online `segment_2` function.

Currently, you can specify 3 dimensions (in the conf file) to view the 
results, you can specify one of them individually, or you can customize 
the combination (that is, specify multiple at the same time).

# Note
We use MySQLdb python lib to fetch meta from FE, so you must install it.

You can get MySQLdb lib from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/MySQL-python, 
then you can install it as follows:
```
$ tar zxvf MySQL-python-*.tar.gz
$ cd MySQL-python-*
$ python setup.py build
$ python setup.py install
``` 

# Steps
1. Fill in the conf according to your cluster configuration, and specify 
   the table or be you want to watch.
2. Execute `python show_segment_status.py`

# Example
1. If you want to watch the process of a table named `xxxx`, you can specify 
   `table_name = xxxx` in conf file

2. If you want to watch the process on be whose be_id is `xxxx`, you can specify 
   `be_id = xxxx` in conf file
