# Compaction Action

This API is used to view the overall compaction status of a BE node or the compaction status of a specified tablet. It can also be used to manually trigger Compaction.

## View Compaction status

### The overall compaction status of the node

(TODO)

### Specify the compaction status of the tablet

```
curl -X GET http://be_host:webserver_port/api/compaction/show?tablet_id=xxxx\&schema_hash=yyyy
```

If the tablet does not exist, an error in JSON format is returned:

```
{
    "status": "Fail",
    "msg": "Tablet not found"
}
```

If the tablet exists, the result is returned in JSON format:

```
{
    "cumulative point": 50,
    "last cumulative failure time": "2019-12-16 18:13:43.224",
    "last base failure time": "2019-12-16 18:13:23.320",
    "last cumu success time": "2019-12-16 18:12:15.110",
    "last base success time": "2019-12-16 18:11:50.780",
    "versions": [
        "[0-48] ",
        "[49-49] ",
        "[50-50] DELETE",
        "[51-51] "
    ]
}
```

Explanation of results:

* cumulative point: The version boundary between base and cumulative compaction. Versions before (excluding) points are handled by base compaction. Versions after (inclusive) are handled by cumulative compaction.
* last cumulative failure time: The time when the last cumulative compaction failed. After 10 minutes by default, cumulative compaction is attempted on the this tablet again.
* last base failure time: The time when the last base compaction failed. After 10 minutes by default, base compaction is attempted on the this tablet again.
* versions: The current data version collection of this tablet. The `DELETE` suffix indicates the delete version.

### Examples

```
curl -X GET http://192.168.10.24:8040/api/compaction/show?tablet_id=10015\&schema_hash=1294206575
```
