# Gitter Manual

## Gitter introduction

Gitter is a Markdown-enabled instant messaging software for developers. It can be seamlessly linked to github, PR on Github can be linked in chat, relevant historical records of discussions can be retained, historical records can be queried, and Chinese and English can be supported.

Like many other open source projects, Doris can use Gitter as an instant messaging medium for technology exchange and community development. This article describes how to use Gitter to participate in Doris's open source development and community development.

## Log in using links

You can use Gitter as well as Wechat, and get functions that are more comfortable for developers and technicians than Wechat, such as directly mentioning an activity for discussion, directly searching history chat records, etc.

Don't forget to click on the Pentagon in the upper right corner to collect, which will make the chat room easier for you to find.
