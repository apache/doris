# ADMIN SET REPLICA STATUS
## description

    This commend is used to set the status of the specified replica.
    This command is currently only used to manually set the status of some replicas to BAD or OK, allowing the system to automatically repair these replicas.

    Syntax:

        ADMIN SET REPLICA STATUS
        PROPERTIES ("key" = "value", ...);

        The following attributes are currently supported:
        "tablet_id": required. Specify a Tablet Id.
        "backend_id": required. Specify a Backend Id.
        "status": required. Specify the status. Only "bad" and "ok" are currently supported.

        If the specified replica does not exist or the status is already bad or ok, it will be ignored.

    Notice:

        Replica set to Bad status may be dropped immediately, please proceed with caution.
