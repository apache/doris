# C++ Code Diagnostic

Doris support to use [Clangd](https://clangd.llvm.org/) and [Clang-Tidy](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/) 
to diagnostic code. Clangd and Clang-Tidy already has in [LDB-toolchain](/docs/install/source-install/compilation-with-ldb-toolchain)ï¼Œalso can install by self.

### Clang-Tidy
Clang-Tidy can do some diagnostic cofig, config file `.clang-tidy` is in Doris root path. Compared with vscode-cpptools, clangd can provide more powerful and accurate code jumping for vscode, and integrates the analysis and quick-fix functions of clang-tidy.

### Enable clangd on VSCODE

First we should install clangd plugin, then edit `settings.json` or just change config on gui.

```json
    "clangd.path": "ldb_toolchain/bin/clangd", //clangd path
    "clangd.arguments": [
        "--background-index",
        "--clang-tidy", //enable clang-tidy
        "--compile-commands-dir=doris/be/build_RELEASE/", //clangd should read compile_commands.json create by cmake, so you should compile once
        "--completion-style=detailed",
        "-j=5", //clangd diagnostic parallelism
        "--all-scopes-completion",
        "--pch-storage=memory",
        "--pretty",
        "-log=verbose",
        "--query-driver=ldb_toolchain/bin/*" //path of compiler
    ],
    "clangd.trace": "/home/disk2/pxl/dev/baidu/bdg/doris/core/output/clangd-server.log" //clangd log path
```
