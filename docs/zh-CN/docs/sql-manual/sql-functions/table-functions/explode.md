## explode

### description

表函数，需配合 Lateral View 使用。

将 array 列展开成多行。当 array 为NULL或者为空时，`explode_outer` 返回NULL。
`explode` 和 `explode_outer` 均会返回 array 内部的NULL元素。

语法：

```
explode(expr)
explode_outer(expr)
```

### example

```
mysql> set enable_vectorized_engine = true

mysql> select e1 from (select 1 k1) as t lateral view explode([1,2,3]) tmp1 as e1;
+------+
| e1   |
+------+
|    1 |
|    2 |
|    3 |

mysql> select e1 from (select 1 k1) as t lateral view explode_outer(null) tmp1 as e1;
