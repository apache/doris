## convert_to
### description
#### Syntax

` convert_to(VARCHAR column, VARCHAR character)`
在order by子句中使用，例如order by convert(column using gbk), 现在仅支持character转为'gbk'.
因为当order by column中包含中文时，其排列不是按照汉语拼音的顺序.
将column的字符编码转为gbk后，可实现按拼音的排列的效果.

</version>

mysql> select * from class_test order by class_name;
+----------+------------+-------------+
| class_id | class_name | student_ids |
+----------+------------+-------------+
