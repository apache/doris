# Data Deletion Recovery

In order to avoid disasters caused by misoperation, Doris supports data recovery of accidentally deleted databases/tables/partitions. After dropping table or database, Doris will not physically delete the data immediately, but will keep it in Trash for a period of time ( The default is 1 day, which can be configured through the `catalog_trash_expire_second` parameter in fe.conf). The administrator can use the RECOVER command to restore accidentally deleted data.

## Start Data Recovery

1.restore the database named example_db

```sql
RECOVER DATABASE example_db;
```

2.restore the table named example_tbl

```sql
RECOVER TABLE example_db.example_tbl;
```

3.restore partition named p1 in table example_tbl

```sql
RECOVER PARTITION p1 FROM example_tbl;
```

## More Help

For more detailed syntax and best practices used by RECOVER, please refer to the [RECOVER](../../sql-manual/sql-reference/Data-Definition-Statements/Backup-and-Restore/RECOVER.md) command manual, You can also type `HELP RECOVER` on the MySql client command line for more help.
