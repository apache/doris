# Compiling with LDB toolchain

This document describes how to compile Doris using the LDB toolchain. This method is currently used as a supplement to the Docker compilation method to facilitate developers and users without a Docker environment to compile Doris source code.

> You can still compile the latest code using the Docker development image: `apache/doris:build-env-ldb-toolchain-latest`

> Thanks to [Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird) for this contribution.

## Prepare the environment

This works for most Linux distributions (CentOS, Ubuntu, etc.).

1. Download `ldb_toolchain_gen.sh`

    The latest `ldb_toolchain_gen.sh` can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/amosbird/ldb_toolchain_gen/releases). This script is used to generate the ldb toolchain.
    
    > For more information, you can visit [https://github.com/amosbird/ldb_toolchain_gen](https://github.com/amosbird/ldb_toolchain_gen)

2. Execute the following command to generate the ldb toolchain

    ```
    sh ldb_toolchain_gen.sh /path/to/ldb_toolchain/
    ```
    
    where `/path/to/ldb_toolchain/` is the directory where the toolchain is installed.
    
    After successful execution, the following directory structure will be created under `/path/to/ldb_toolchain/`.
    
    ```
    ├── bin
    ├── include
    ├── lib
    ├── share
    ├── test
    └── usr
    ```
    
3. Download and install other compiled components

    1. [Java8](https://doris-thirdparty-repo.bj.bcebos.com/thirdparty/jdk-8u131-linux-x64.tar.gz)
    2. [Apache Maven 3.6.3](https://doris-thirdparty-repo.bj.bcebos.com/thirdparty/apache-maven-3.6.3-bin.tar.gz)
    3. [Node v12.13.0](https://doris-thirdparty-repo.bj.bcebos.com/thirdparty/node-v12.13.0-linux-x64.tar.gz)

    If your environment is somehow minimal, additional packages should be installed before compiling Doris. The following instructions describe how to setup a minimal CentOS 6 box to compile Doris. Other linux distros should be similar.

    ```
    # install required system packages
    sudo yum install -y byacc patch automake libtool make which file ncurses-devel gettext-devel unzip bzip2 zip util-linux wget git python2
    
    # install autoconf-2.69
    wget http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/autoconf/autoconf-2.69.tar.gz && \
        tar zxf autoconf-2.69.tar.gz && \
        cd autoconf-2.69 && \
        ./configure && \
        make && \
        make install
    
    # install bison-3.0.4
    wget http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bison/bison-3.0.4.tar.gz && \
        tar xzf bison-3.0.4.tar.gz && \
        cd bison-3.0.4 && \
        ./configure && \
        make && \
        make install
    ```

4. Download Doris source code

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/apache/doris.git
    ```
    
    After downloading, go to the Doris source directory, create the `custom_env.sh`, file, and set the PATH environment variable, e.g.
    
    ```
    export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/java/
    export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
    export PATH=/path/to/maven/bin:$PATH
    export PATH=/path/to/node/bin:$PATH
    export PATH=/path/to/ldb_toolchain/bin:$PATH
    ```

## Compiling Doris

Enter the Doris source code directory and execute:

```
$ cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep avx2
```

Check whether the compilation machine supports the avx2 instruction set

If it is not supported, use the following command to compile

```
$ USE_AVX2=0 sh build.sh
```

If supported, execute `sh build.sh` directly

This script will compile the third-party libraries first and then the Doris components (FE, BE) later. The compiled output is in the `output/` directory.
