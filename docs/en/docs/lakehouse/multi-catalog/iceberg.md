# Iceberg

## Usage

When connecting to Iceberg, Doris:

1. Supports Iceberg V1/V2 table formats;
2. Supports Position Delete but not Equality Delete for V2 format;

## Create Catalog

### Hive Metastore Catalog

Same as creating Hive Catalogs. A simple example is provided here. See [Hive](./hive.md) for more information.

```sql
CREATE CATALOG iceberg PROPERTIES (
    'type'='hms',
    'hive.metastore.uris' = 'thrift://172.21.0.1:7004',
    'hadoop.username' = 'hive',
    'dfs.nameservices'='your-nameservice',
    'dfs.ha.namenodes.your-nameservice'='nn1,nn2',
    'dfs.namenode.rpc-address.your-nameservice.nn1'='172.21.0.2:4007',
    'dfs.namenode.rpc-address.your-nameservice.nn2'='172.21.0.3:4007',
    'dfs.client.failover.proxy.provider.your-nameservice'='org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode.ha.ConfiguredFailoverProxyProvider'
);
```

### Iceberg Native Catalog

<version since="dev">

Access metadata with the iceberg API. The Hive, REST, Glue and other services can serve as the iceberg catalog.

</version>

#### Using Iceberg Hive Catalog

```sql
CREATE CATALOG iceberg PROPERTIES (
    'type'='iceberg',
    'iceberg.catalog.type'='hms',
    'hive.metastore.uris' = 'thrift://172.21.0.1:7004',
    'hadoop.username' = 'hive',
    'dfs.nameservices'='your-nameservice',
    'dfs.ha.namenodes.your-nameservice'='nn1,nn2',
    'dfs.namenode.rpc-address.your-nameservice.nn1'='172.21.0.2:4007',
    'dfs.namenode.rpc-address.your-nameservice.nn2'='172.21.0.3:4007',
    'dfs.client.failover.proxy.provider.your-nameservice'='org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode.ha.ConfiguredFailoverProxyProvider'
);
```

#### Using Iceberg Glue Catalog

```sql
CREATE CATALOG glue PROPERTIES (
"type"="iceberg",
"iceberg.catalog.type" = "glue",
"glue.endpoint" = "https://glue.us-east-1.amazonaws.com",
"warehouse" = "s3://bucket/warehouse",
"AWS_ENDPOINT" = "s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com",
"AWS_REGION" = "us-east-1",
"AWS_ACCESS_KEY" = "ak",
"AWS_SECRET_KEY" = "sk",
"use_path_style" = "true"
);
```

`glue.endpoint`: Glue Endpoint. See [AWS Glue endpoints and quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/glue.html).

`warehouse`: Glue Warehouse Location.  To determine the root path of the data warehouse in storage.

The other properties can refer to [Iceberg Glue Catalog](https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/latest/aws/#glue-catalog)

- Using Iceberg REST Catalog

RESTful service as the server side. Implementing RESTCatalog interface of iceberg to obtain metadata.

```sql
CREATE CATALOG iceberg PROPERTIES (
    'type'='iceberg',
    'iceberg.catalog.type'='rest',
    'uri' = 'http://172.21.0.1:8181',
);
```

If you want to use S3 storage, the following properties need to be set.

```
"AWS_ACCESS_KEY" = "ak"
"AWS_SECRET_KEY" = "sk"
"AWS_REGION" = "region-name"
"AWS_ENDPOINT" = "http://endpoint-uri"
"AWS_CREDENTIALS_PROVIDER" = "provider-class-name" // Optional. The default credentials class is based on BasicAWSCredentials.
```

## Column Type Mapping

Same as that in Hive Catalogs. See the relevant section in [Hive](./hive.md).

## Time Travel

<version since="dev">

Doris supports reading the specified Snapshot of Iceberg tables.

</version>

Each write operation to an Iceberg table will generate a new Snapshot.

By default, a read request will only read the latest Snapshot.

You can read data of historical table versions using the  `FOR TIME AS OF`  or  `FOR VERSION AS OF`  statements based on the Snapshot ID or the timepoint the Snapshot is generated. For example:

`SELECT * FROM iceberg_tbl FOR TIME AS OF "2022-10-07 17:20:37";`

`SELECT * FROM iceberg_tbl FOR VERSION AS OF 868895038966572;`

You can use the [iceberg_meta](https://doris.apache.org/docs/dev/sql-manual/sql-functions/table-functions/iceberg_meta/) table function to view the Snapshot details of the specified table.
