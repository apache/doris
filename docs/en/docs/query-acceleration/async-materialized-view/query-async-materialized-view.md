## Overview

Doris's asynchronous materialized views employ a structure based on the SPJG (SELECT-PROJECT-JOIN-GROUP-BY) pattern 
for transparent rewriting algorithms. Doris can analyze the structural information of the query SQL, 
automatically identify suitable materialized views, and attempt transparent rewriting by expressing the 
query SQL using the materialized views. By utilizing precomputed materialized view results, 
significant improvements in query performance and a reduction in computational costs can be achieved.

Using the three tables: lineitem, orders, and partsupp from TPC-H, let's describe the capability of directly querying
a materialized view and using the materialized view for transparent query rewriting.
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS lineitem (
    l_orderkey    integer not null,
    l_partkey     integer not null,
    l_suppkey     integer not null,
    l_linenumber  integer not null,
    l_quantity    decimalv3(15,2) not null,
    l_extendedprice  decimalv3(15,2) not null,
    l_discount    decimalv3(15,2) not null,
    l_tax         decimalv3(15,2) not null,
    l_returnflag  char(1) not null,
    l_linestatus  char(1) not null,
    l_shipdate    date not null,
    l_commitdate  date not null,
    l_receiptdate date not null,
    l_shipinstruct char(25) not null,
    l_shipmode     char(10) not null,
    l_comment      varchar(44) not null
    )
    DUPLICATE KEY(l_orderkey, l_partkey, l_suppkey, l_linenumber)
    PARTITION BY RANGE(l_shipdate)
    (FROM ('2023-10-17') TO ('2023-10-20') INTERVAL 1 DAY)
    DISTRIBUTED BY HASH(l_orderkey) BUCKETS 3
    PROPERTIES ("replication_num" = "1");
```
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS orders  (
    o_orderkey       integer not null,
    o_custkey        integer not null,
    o_orderstatus    char(1) not null,
    o_totalprice     decimalv3(15,2) not null,
    o_orderdate      date not null,
    o_orderpriority  char(15) not null,
    o_clerk          char(15) not null,
    o_shippriority   integer not null,
    o_comment        varchar(79) not null
    )
    DUPLICATE KEY(o_orderkey, o_custkey)
    PARTITION BY RANGE(o_orderdate)(
    FROM ('2023-10-17') TO ('2023-10-20') INTERVAL 1 DAY)
    DISTRIBUTED BY HASH(o_orderkey) BUCKETS 3
    PROPERTIES ("replication_num" = "1");
```

```sql
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS partsupp (
      ps_partkey     INTEGER NOT NULL,
      ps_suppkey     INTEGER NOT NULL,
      ps_availqty    INTEGER NOT NULL,
      ps_supplycost  DECIMALV3(15,2)  NOT NULL,
      ps_comment     VARCHAR(199) NOT NULL 
    )
    DUPLICATE KEY(ps_partkey, ps_suppkey)
    DISTRIBUTED BY HASH(ps_partkey) BUCKETS 3
    PROPERTIES (
      "replication_num" = "1"
    );
```

## Direct Query of Materialized View
A materialized view can be considered as a table and can be queried just like a regular table.

The syntax for defining a materialized view, details can be found in 
[CREATE-ASYNC-MATERIALIZED-VIEW](../../sql-manual/sql-reference/Data-Definition-Statements/Create/CREATE-ASYNC-MATERIALIZED-VIEW.md)

Materialized view definition:
```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv1
BUILD IMMEDIATE REFRESH AUTO ON SCHEDULE EVERY 1 hour
DISTRIBUTED BY RANDOM BUCKETS 12
PROPERTIES ('replication_num' = '1')
AS
SELECT t1.l_linenumber,
       o_custkey,
       o_orderdate
FROM (SELECT * FROM lineitem WHERE l_linenumber > 1) t1
         LEFT OUTER JOIN orders
                         ON l_orderkey = o_orderkey;
```

Query statement:
Direct queries can be performed on the materialized view with additional filtering conditions and aggregations.
      
```sql
SELECT l_linenumber,
       o_custkey
FROM mv1
WHERE l_linenumber > 1 and o_orderdate = '2023-12-31';
```      

## Transparent Rewriting Capability
### Join rewriting

JOIN rewriting refers to the ability to transparently rewrite a query when the tables used in the query and 
the materialized view are the same. This rewriting can occur either by joining the materialized view 
and the query inside the JOIN clause or by placing conditions in the WHERE clause outside of the JOIN. 
Additionally, under certain conditions, when the types of JOINs in the query and the materialized view do not match, 
rewriting can still take place.

**Case 1:**

The following case can undergo transparent rewriting. The condition `l_linenumber > 1` allows for pull-up, 
enabling transparent rewriting by expressing the query using the precomputed results of the materialized view.

Materialized view definition:
```sql
SELECT t1.l_linenumber,
       o_custkey,
       o_orderdate
FROM (SELECT * FROM lineitem WHERE l_linenumber > 1) t1
LEFT OUTER JOIN orders
ON l_orderkey = o_orderkey;
```
Query statement:

```sql
SELECT l_linenumber,
       o_custkey
FROM lineitem
LEFT OUTER JOIN orders
ON l_orderkey = o_orderkey
WHERE l_linenumber > 1 and o_orderdate = '2023-12-31';
```

**Case 2:**

JOIN Derivation (Coming soon)
When the types of JOINs in the query and the materialized view do not match, but the materialized view can provide 
all the data required for the query, transparent rewriting can also occur by compensating predicates above the JOIN. 
For example:

Materialized view definition:
```sql
SELECT
    l_shipdate, l_suppkey, o_orderdate
    sum(o_totalprice) AS sum_total,
    max(o_totalprice) AS max_total,
    min(o_totalprice) AS min_total,
    count(*) AS count_all,
    count(distinct CASE WHEN o_shippriority > 1 AND o_orderkey IN (1, 3) THEN o_custkey ELSE null END) AS bitmap_union_basic
FROM lineitem
LEFT OUTER JOIN orders ON lineitem.l_orderkey = orders.o_orderkey AND l_shipdate = o_orderdate
GROUP BY
l_shipdate,
l_suppkey,
o_orderdate;
```

Query statement:
```sql
SELECT
    l_shipdate, l_suppkey, o_orderdate
    sum(o_totalprice) AS sum_total,
    max(o_totalprice) AS max_total,
    min(o_totalprice) AS min_total,
    count(*) AS count_all,
    count(distinct CASE WHEN o_shippriority > 1 AND o_orderkey IN (1, 3) THEN o_custkey ELSE null END) AS bitmap_union_basic
FROM lineitem
INNER JOIN orders ON lineitem.l_orderkey = orders.o_orderkey AND l_shipdate = o_orderdate
WHERE o_orderdate = '2023-12-11' AND l_suppkey = 3
GROUP BY
l_shipdate,
l_suppkey,
o_orderdate;
```

### Aggregate rewriting

**Case 1**

The following case can undergo transparent rewriting. The query and the materialized view use consistent dimensions 
for aggregation, allowing the use of fields from the dimensions to filter results. The query will attempt to use the 
expressions after SELECT in the materialized view.

Materialized view definition:

```sql
SELECT
    o_shippriority, o_comment,
    count(distinct CASE WHEN o_shippriority > 1 AND o_orderkey IN (1, 3) THEN o_custkey ELSE null END) AS cnt_1,
    count(distinct CASE WHEN O_SHIPPRIORITY > 2 AND o_orderkey IN (2) THEN o_custkey ELSE null END) AS cnt_2,
    sum(o_totalprice),
    max(o_totalprice),
    min(o_totalprice),
    count(*)
FROM orders
GROUP BY
o_shippriority,
o_comment;
```

Query statement:

```sql
SELECT 
    o_shippriority, o_comment,
    count(distinct CASE WHEN o_shippriority > 1 AND o_orderkey IN (1, 3) THEN o_custkey ELSE null END) AS cnt_1,
    count(distinct CASE WHEN O_SHIPPRIORITY > 2 AND o_orderkey IN (2) THEN o_custkey ELSE null END) AS cnt_2,
    sum(o_totalprice),
    max(o_totalprice),
    min(o_totalprice),
    count(*)
FROM orders
WHERE o_shippriority in (1, 2)
GROUP BY
o_shippriority,
o_comment;
```

**Case 2**

The following query can undergo transparent rewriting. The query and the materialized view use inconsistent 
dimensions for aggregation, where the dimensions used by the materialized view include those used by the query. 
The query will attempt to roll up using the functions after SELECT, such as the materialized view's 
bitmap_union will eventually roll up into bitmap_union_count, maintaining consistency with the semantics of 
the count(distinct) in the query.

Materialized view definition:

```sql
SELECT
    l_shipdate, o_orderdate, l_partkey, l_suppkey,
    sum(o_totalprice) AS sum_total,
    max(o_totalprice) AS max_total,
    min(o_totalprice) AS min_total,
    count(*) AS count_all,
    bitmap_union(to_bitmap(CASE WHEN o_shippriority > 1 AND o_orderkey IN (1, 3) THEN o_custkey ELSE null END)) AS bitmap_union_basic
FROM lineitem
LEFT OUTER JOIN orders ON lineitem.l_orderkey = orders.o_orderkey AND l_shipdate = o_orderdate
GROUP BY
l_shipdate,
o_orderdate,
l_partkey,
l_suppkey;
```

Query statement:

```sql
SELECT
    l_shipdate, l_suppkey,
    sum(o_totalprice) AS sum_total,
    max(o_totalprice) AS max_total,
    min(o_totalprice) AS min_total,
    count(*) AS count_all,
    count(distinct CASE WHEN o_shippriority > 1 AND o_orderkey IN (1, 3) THEN o_custkey ELSE null END) AS bitmap_union_basic
FROM lineitem
LEFT OUTER JOIN orders ON lineitem.l_orderkey = orders.o_orderkey AND l_shipdate = o_orderdate
WHERE o_orderdate = '2023-12-11' AND l_partkey = 3
GROUP BY
l_shipdate,
l_suppkey;
```

Temporary support for the aggregation roll-up functions is as follows:

| Functions in Queries | Functions in Materialized Views  | Aggregation Functions After Rewriting |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| max                  | max                              | max                                   |
| min                  | min                              | min                                   |
| sum                  | sum                              | sum                                   |
| count                | count                            | sum                                   |
| count(distinct )     | bitmap_union                     | bitmap_union_count                    |
| bitmap_union         | bitmap_union                     | bitmap_union                          |
| bitmap_union_count   | bitmap_union                     | bitmap_union_count                    |

## Query partial Transparent Rewriting (Coming soon)
When the number of tables in the materialized view is greater than the query, if the materialized view 
satisfies the conditions for JOIN elimination for tables more than the query, transparent rewriting can also occur. 
For example:

**Case 1**

Materialized view definition:

```sql
 SELECT
     l_linenumber,
     o_custkey,
     ps_availqty
 FROM lineitem
 LEFT OUTER JOIN orders ON L_ORDERKEY = O_ORDERKEY
 LEFT OUTER JOIN partsupp ON l_partkey = ps_partkey
 AND l_suppkey = ps_suppkey;
```

Query statement:
```sql
 SELECT
     l_linenumber,
     o_custkey,
     ps_availqty
 FROM lineitem
 LEFT OUTER JOIN orders ON L_ORDERKEY = O_ORDERKEY;
```

## Union Rewriting (Coming soon)
When the materialized view is not sufficient to provide all the data for the query, it can use Union to return 
data by combining the original table and the materialized view. 
For example:

**Case 1**

Materialized view definition:

```sql
SELECT
    o_orderkey,
    o_custkey,
    o_orderstatus,
    o_totalprice
FROM orders
WHERE o_orderkey > 10;
```

Query statement:
```sql
SELECT
    o_orderkey,
    o_custkey,
    o_orderstatus,
    o_totalprice
FROM orders
WHERE o_orderkey > 5;
```

Rewriting result:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM mv
UNION ALL
SELECT
    o_orderkey,
    o_custkey,
    o_orderstatus,
    o_totalprice
FROM orders
WHERE o_orderkey > 5 AND o_orderkey <= 10;
```

## Auxiliary Functions
**Data Consistency Issues After Transparent Rewriting**

For internal tables in the materialized view, you can control the maximum delay allowed for the data used by 
the transparent rewriting by setting the grace_period property. 
Refer to [CREATE-ASYNC-MATERIALIZED-VIEW](../../sql-manual/sql-reference/Data-Definition-Statements/Create/CREATE-ASYNC-MATERIALIZED-VIEW.md)

**Viewing and Debugging Transparent Rewrite Hit Information**

You can use the following statements to view the hit information of transparent rewriting for a materialized view. It will display a concise overview of the transparent rewriting process.

`explain <query_sql>`

If you want to know the detailed information about materialized view candidates, rewriting, and the final selection process, you can execute the following statement. It will provide a detailed breakdown of the transparent rewriting process.

## Limitations
- The materialized view definition statement only allows SELECT, FROM, WHERE, JOIN, and GROUP BY statements, and
the input to JOIN cannot contain GROUP BY. Only INNER and LEFT OUTER JOIN types are currently supported; other
types of JOIN operations will be supported gradually.
- Materialized views based on External Tables do not guarantee strong consistency of query results.
- No support for rewriting non-deterministic functions, including rand, now, current_time, current_date, random, uuid, etc.
- No support for rewriting window functions.
- The definition of materialized views currently cannot use views and other materialized views.
- Currently, WHERE condition compensation supports cases where the materialized view has no WHERE clause, and
the query has a WHERE clause; or the materialized view has a WHERE clause, and the query's WHERE condition is a
superset of the materialized view's. Currently, range condition compensation is not yet supported,
such as the materialized view definition being a > 5, and the query being a > 10.
