# Audit Log Plugin

Doris's audit log plugin was developed based on FE's plugin framework. Is an optional plugin. Users can install or uninstall this plugin at runtime.

This plugin can periodically import the FE audit log into the specified Doris cluster, so that users can easily view and analyze the audit log through SQL.

## Compile, Configure and Deploy

### FE Configuration

The audit log plug-in framework is disabled by default in Doris. You need to add `plugin_enable = true `to the FE configuration file to enable plugin framework.

### AuditLoader Configuration

The configuration of the auditloader plugin is located in `$ {DORIS}/fe_plugins/auditloader/src/main/assembly/`.

Open `plugin.conf` for configuration. See the comments of the configuration items.

<version since="1.2.0"></version>
Audit log plugin supports importing slow query logs into a separate slow table since version 1.2, `doris_slow_log_tbl__`,  which is closed by default. In the plugin configuration file, add `enable_slow_log = true` to enable the function. And you could modify 'qe_slow_log_ms' item in FE configuration file to change slow query threshold.

### Compile

After executing `sh build_plugin.sh` in the Doris code directory, you will get the `auditloader.zip` file in the `fe_plugins/output` directory.

### Deployment

You can place this file on an http download server or copy(or unzip) it to the specified directory of all FEs. Here we use the latter.

### Installation

After deployment is complete, and before installing the plugin, you need to create the audit log database and tables previously specified in `plugin.conf`. If `enable_slow_log` is set true, the slow table `doris_slow_log_tbl__` needs to be created, with the same schema as `doris_audit_log_tbl__`. The database and table creation statement is as follows:

```
create database doris_audit_db__;

create table doris_audit_db__.doris_audit_log_tbl__
(
    query_id varchar(48) comment "Unique query id",
    `time` datetime not null comment "Query start time",

> In the above table structure: stmt string, this can only be used in 0.15 and later versions, in previous versions, the field type used varchar

The `dynamic_partition` attribute selects the number of days to keep the audit log based on your needs.

After that, connect to Doris and use the `INSTALL PLUGIN` command to complete the installation. After successful installation, you can see the installed plug-ins through `SHOW PLUGINS`, and the status is `INSTALLED`.

Upon completion, the plug-in will continuously import audit date into this table at specified intervals.
