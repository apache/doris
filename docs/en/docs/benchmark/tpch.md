# TPC-H Benchmark

TPC-H is a decision support benchmark (Decision Support Benchmark), which consists of a set of business-oriented special query and concurrent data modification. The data that is queried and populates the database has broad industry relevance. This benchmark demonstrates a decision support system that examines large amounts of data, executes highly complex queries, and answers key business questions. The performance index reported by TPC-H is called TPC-H composite query performance index per hour (QphH@Size), which reflects multiple aspects of the system's ability to process queries. These aspects include the database size chosen when executing the query, the query processing capability when the query is submitted by a single stream, and the query throughput when the query is submitted by many concurrent users.

This document mainly introduces the performance of Doris on the TPC-H 100G test set.

> Note 1: The standard test set including TPC-H is usually far from the actual business scenario, and some tests will perform parameter tuning for the test set. Therefore, the test results of the standard test set can only reflect the performance of the database in a specific scenario. We suggest users use actual business data for further testing.
>
> Note 2: The operations involved in this document are all tested on CentOS 7.x.
>
> Note 3: Doris starting from version 1.2.2, the page cache is turned off by default to reduce memory usage, which has a certain impact on performance. For performance testing, enable the page cache by adding disable_storage_page_cache=false to be.conf.

On 22 queries on the TPC-H standard test data set, we conducted a comparison test based on Apache Doris 1.2.0-rc01, Apache Doris 1.1.3 and Apache Doris 0.15.0 RC04 versions. Compared with Apache Doris 1.1.3, the overall performance of Apache Doris 1.2.0-rc01 has been improved by nearly 3 times, and by nearly 11 times compared with Apache Doris 0.15.0 RC04.

## 4. Test SQL

TPCH 22 test query statements ： [TPCH-Query-SQL](https://github.com/apache/doris/tree/master/tools/tpch-tools/queries)

**Notice:**

The following four parameters in the above SQL do not exist in Apache Doris 0.15.0 RC04. When executing, please remove:

```
1. enable_vectorized_engine=true,
2. batch_size=4096,
3. disable_join_reorder=false
4. enable_projection=true
```

## 5. Test Results

Here we use Apache Doris 1.2.0-rc01, Apache Doris 1.1.3 and Apache Doris 0.15.0 RC04 for comparative testing. In the test, we use Query Time(ms) as the main performance indicator. The test results are as follows:

| Query    | Apache Doris 1.2.0-rc01 (ms) | Apache Doris 1.1.3 (ms) | Apache Doris 0.15.0 RC04 (ms) |

- **Result Description**
    - The data set corresponding to the test results is scale 100, about 600 million.
    - The test environment is configured as the user's common configuration, with 4 cloud servers, 16-core 64G SSD, and 1 FE 3 BEs deployment.
    - Select the user's common configuration test to reduce the cost of user selection and evaluation, but the entire test process will not consume so many hardware resources.
    - Apache Doris 0.15 RC04 failed to execute Q14 in the TPC-H test, unable to complete the query.

## 6. Environmental Preparation

Please refer to the [official document](../install/standard-deployment.md) to install and deploy Doris to obtain a normal running Doris cluster (at least 1 FE 1 BE, 1 FE 3 BE is recommended).

## 7. Data Preparation

### 7.1 Download and Install TPC-H Data Generation Tool

Execute the following script to download and compile the [tpch-tools](https://github.com/apache/doris/tree/master/tools/tpch-tools) tool.

```shell
sh build-tpch-dbgen.sh
```

After successful installation, the `dbgen` binary will be generated under the `TPC-H_Tools_v3.0.0/` directory.

### 7.2 Generating the TPC-H Test Set

Execute the following script to generate the TPC-H dataset:

```shell
sh gen-tpch-data.sh
```

> Note 1: Check the script help via `sh gen-tpch-data.sh -h`.
>
> Note 2: The data will be generated under the `tpch-data/` directory with the suffix `.tbl`. The total file size is about 100GB and may need a few minutes to an hour to generate.
>
> Note 3: A standard test data set of 100G is generated by default.

### 7.3 Create Table

#### 7.3.1 Prepare the `doris-cluster.conf` File

Before import the script, you need to write the FE’s ip port and other information in the `doris-cluster.conf` file.

The file is located under `${DORIS_HOME}/tools/tpch-tools/conf/` .

The content of the file includes FE's ip, HTTP port, user name, password and the DB name of the data to be imported:

```shell
# Any of FE host
export FE_HOST='127.0.0.1'
# http_port in fe.conf
export FE_HTTP_PORT=8030
# query_port in fe.conf
export FE_QUERY_PORT=9030
# Doris username
export USER='root'
# Doris password
export PASSWORD=''
# The database where TPC-H tables located
export DB='tpch1'
```

#### Execute the Following Script to Generate and Create TPC-H Table

```shell
sh create-tpch-tables.sh
```
Or copy the table creation statement in [create-tpch-tables.sql](https://github.com/apache/doris/tree/master/tools/tpch-tools/ddl/create-tpch-tables.sql) and excute it in Doris.


### 7.4 Import Data

Please perform data import with the following command:

```shell
sh ./load-tpch-data.sh
```

### 7.5 Check Imported Data

Execute the following SQL statement to check that the imported data is consistent with the above data.

```sql
select count(*)  from  lineitem;
select count(*)  from  orders;
select count(*)  from  partsupp;
select count(*)  from  part;
select count(*)  from  customer;
select count(*)  from  supplier;
select count(*)  from  nation;
select count(*)  from  region;
select count(*)  from  revenue0;
```

### 7.6 Query Test

#### 7.6.1 Executing Query Scripts

Execute the above test SQL or execute the following command

```
./run-tpch-queries.sh
```

>Notice:
>
>1. At present, the query optimizer and statistics functions of Doris are not so perfect, so we rewrite some queries in TPC-H to adapt to the execution framework of Doris, but it does not affect the correctness of the results
>
>2. Doris' new query optimizer will be released in future versions
>3. Set `set exec_mem_limit=8G` before executing the query

#### 7.6.2 Single SQL Execution

The following is the SQL statement used in the test, you can also get the latest SQL from the code base.

```SQL
