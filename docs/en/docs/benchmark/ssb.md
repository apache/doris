# Star Schema Benchmark

[Star Schema Benchmark(SSB)](https://www.cs.umb.edu/~poneil/StarSchemaB.PDF) is a performance test set in a lightweight data warehouse scenario. Based on [TPC-H](http://www.tpc.org/tpch/), SSB provides a simplified version of the star schema dataset, which is mainly used to test the performance of multi-table association queries under the star schema. . In addition, the industry usually flattens SSB as a wide table model (hereinafter referred to as: SSB flat) to test the performance of the query engine, refer to [Clickhouse](https://clickhouse.com/docs/zh/getting-started /example-datasets/star-schema).

This document mainly introduces the performance of Doris on the SSB 100G test set.

> Note 1: The standard test set including SSB is usually far from the actual business scenario, and some tests will perform parameter tuning for the test set. Therefore, the test results of the standard test set can only reflect the performance of the database in specific scenarios. Users are advised to conduct further testing with actual business data.
>
> Note 2: The operations involved in this document are all performed in the Ubuntu Server 20.04 environment, and CentOS 7 can also be tested.

We conducted pairwise testing on 13 queries on the SSB standard test dataset based on Apache Doris 1.2.0-rc01, Apache Doris 1.1.3 and Apache Doris 0.15.0 RC04 versions.

The overall performance improvement on SSB FlAT wide tables was nearly 4x on Apache Doris 1.2.0-rc01 compared to Apache Doris 1.1.3, and nearly 10x on Apache Doris 0.15.0 RC04.

![ssb_v11_v015_compare](/images/ssb_flat.png)

On the standard SSB test SQL, Apache Doris 1.2.0-rc01 delivers an overall performance improvement of nearly 2X over Apache Doris 1.1.3 and nearly 31X over Apache Doris 0.15.0 RC04.

**Interpretation of results**

- The data set corresponding to the test results is scale 100, about 600 million.
- The test environment is configured to be commonly used by users, including 4 cloud servers, 16-core 64G SSD, and 1 FE and 3 BE deployment.
- Use common user configuration tests to reduce user selection and evaluation costs, but will not consume so many hardware resources during the entire test process.

## 6. Environment Preparation

Please first refer to the [official documentation](. /install/install-deploy.md) for Apache Doris installation and deployment to get a working Doris cluster (at least 1 FE 1 BE, 1 FE 3 BE recommended).

The scripts covered in the following documentation are stored in the Apache Doris codebase: [ssb-tools](https://github.com/apache/doris/tree/master/tools/ssb-tools)

## 7. Data Preparation

### 7.1 Download and install the SSB data generation tool.

Execute the following script to download and compile the [ssb-dbgen](https://github.com/electrum/ssb-dbgen.git) tool.

```shell
sh build-ssb-dbgen.sh
````

After successful installation, the `dbgen` binary will be generated in the `ssb-dbgen/` directory.

### 7.2 Generate SSB test set

Execute the following script to generate the SSB dataset:

```shell
sh gen-ssb-data.sh -s 100 -c 100
````

> Note 1: See script help with `sh gen-ssb-data.sh -h`.
>
> Note 2: The data will be generated in the `ssb-data/` directory with the suffix `.tbl`. The total file size is about 60GB. The generation time may vary from a few minutes to an hour.
>
> Note 3: `-s 100` indicates that the test set size factor is 100, `-c 100` indicates that 100 concurrent threads generate data for the lineorder table. The `-c` parameter also determines the number of files in the final lineorder table. The larger the parameter, the larger the number of files and the smaller each file.

With the `-s 100` parameter, the resulting dataset size is:

| Table     | Rows             | Size | File Number |
| --------- | ---------------- | ---- | ----------- |
| lineorder | 6亿（600037902） | 60GB | 100         |
| customer  | 300万（3000000） | 277M | 1           |
| part      | 140万（1400000） | 116M | 1           |
| supplier  | 20万（200000）   | 17M  | 1           |
| date      | 2556             | 228K | 1           |

### 7.3 Create table

#### 7.3.1 Prepare the `doris-cluster.conf` file.

Before calling the import script, you need to write the FE's ip port and other information in the `doris-cluster.conf` file.

File location and `load-ssb-dimension-data.sh` level.

The contents of the file include FE's ip, HTTP port, user name, password and the DB name of the data to be imported:

```shell
export FE_HOST="xxx"
export FE_HTTP_PORT="8030"
export FE_QUERY_PORT="9030"
export USER="root"
export PASSWORD='xxx'
export DB="ssb"
```

#### 7.3.2 Execute the following script to generate and create the SSB table:

```shell
sh create-ssb-tables.sh
````

Or copy [create-ssb-tables.sql](https://github.com/apache/incubator-doris/tree/master/tools/ssb-tools/ddl/create-ssb-tables.sql) and [ create-ssb-flat-table.sql](https://github.com/apache/incubator-doris/tree/master/tools/ssb-tools/ddl/create-ssb-flat-table.sql) of the The create table statements are executed in the MySQL client.

The following is the `lineorder_flat` table build statement. The `lineorder_flat` table is created in the `create-ssb-flat-table.sh` script above with the default number of buckets (48 buckets). You can delete this table and tune this bucketing number according to your cluster size node configuration to get better one test results.

```sql
CREATE TABLE `lineorder_flat` (
  `LO_ORDERDATE` date NOT NULL COMMENT "",

);
```

### 7.4 Import data

We use the following command to complete the import of all data from SSB test set and SSB FLAT wide table data synthesis and import into the table.

```shell
 sh bin/load-ssb-data.sh -c 10
```

`-c 5` means start 10 concurrent threads for import (default is 5). In the single BE node case, the lineorder data generated by `sh gen-ssb-data.sh -s 100 -c 100` will also generate the data of the ssb-flat table at the end, if more threads are started, it can speed up the import, but it will add extra memory overhead.

> Notes.
>
> 1. This configuration indicates the number of write threads per data directory, and the default is 2. Larger data can improve write data throughput, but may increase IO Util. (Reference value: 1 mechanical disk, at default is 2, the IO Util during import is about 12%, and when set to 5, the IO Util is about 26%. (In case of SSD disks, it is almost 0).
> 
> 2. flat table data using 'INSERT INTO ... SELECT ... ' method to import.

### 7.5 Check imported data


```sql
select count(*) from part;
select count(*) from customer;
select count(*) from supplier;
select count(*) from date;
select count(*) from lineorder;
select count(*) from lineorder_flat;
```

The amount of data should be the same as the number of rows that generate the data.

| Table          | Rows             | Origin Size | Compacted Size(1 Replica) |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ----------- | ------------------------- |
