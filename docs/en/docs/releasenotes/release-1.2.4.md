# Behavior Changed

- For `DateV2`/`DatetimeV2` and `DecimalV3` type, in the results of `DESCRIBLE` and `SHOW CREATE TABLE` statements, they will no longer be displayed as `DateV2`/`DatetimeV2` or `DecimalV3`, but directly displayed as `Date`/`Datetime` or `Decimal`.

	- This change is for compatibility with some BI tools. If you want to see the actual type of the column, you can check it with the `DESCRIBE ALL` statement.

- When querying tables in the `information_schema` database, the meta information(database, table, column, etc.) in the external catalog is no longer returned by default.

	- This change avoids the problem that the `information_schema` database cannot be queried due to the connection problem of some external catalog, so as to solve the problem of using some BI tools with Doris. It can be controlled by the FE configuration  `infodb_support_ext_catalog`, and the default value is `false`, that is, the meta information of external catalog will not be returned.
