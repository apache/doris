## running_difference

### description
#### Syntax

`running_difference(x);`

Calculates the difference between successive row values ​​in the data block. 
The result of the function depends on the affected data blocks and the order of data in the block.

The rows order used during the calculation of running_difference can differ from the order of rows returned to the user. To prevent that you can make a subquery with **ORDER BY** and call the function from outside the subquery.

#### Arguments
`x` - A list of data.TINYINT,SMALLINT,INT,BIGINT,LARGEINT,FLOAT,DOUBLE,DATE,DATETIME,DECIMAL

##### Returned value
Returns 0 for the first row and the difference from the previous row for each subsequent row

### example

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS running_difference_test;

CREATE TABLE running_difference_test (
                 `id` int NOT NULL COMMENT 'id' ,
                `day` date COMMENT 'day', 
	`time_val` datetime COMMENT 'time_val',
 	`doublenum` double NULL COMMENT 'doublenum'
                )
DUPLICATE KEY(id) 
DISTRIBUTED BY HASH(id) BUCKETS 3

    "replication_num" = "1"
