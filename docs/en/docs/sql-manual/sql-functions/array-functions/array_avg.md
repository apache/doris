### description

Get the average of all elements in an array (`NULL` values are skipped).
When the array is empty or all elements in the array are `NULL` values, the function returns `NULL`.

### example

```shell
mysql> create table array_type_table(k1 INT, k2 Array<int>) duplicate key (k1)
    -> distributed by hash(k1) buckets 1 properties('replication_num' = '1');
mysql> insert into array_type_table values (0, []), (1, [NULL]), (2, [1, 2, 3]), (3, [1, NULL, 3]);
mysql> set enable_vectorized_engine = true;    # enable vectorized engine
mysql> select k2, array_avg(k2) from array_type_table;
+--------------+-----------------+
| k2           | array_avg(`k2`) |
+--------------+-----------------+
| []           |            NULL |
| [NULL]       |            NULL |
| [1, 2, 3]    |               2 |
| [1, NULL, 3] |               2 |
