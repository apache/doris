#### Syntax

`VARCHAR GROUP_CONCAT([DISTINCT] VARCHAR str[, VARCHAR sep] [ORDER BY { col_name | expr} [ASC | DESC]])`


This function is an aggregation function similar to sum (), and group_concat links multiple rows of results in the result set to a string. The second parameter, sep, is a connection symbol between strings, which can be omitted. This function usually needs to be used with group by statements.
