The information displayed by the `frontends_disks` tvf is basically consistent with the information displayed by the `show frontends disks` statement. However, the types of each field in the `frontends_disks` tvf are more specific, and you can use the `frontends_disks` tvf to perform operations such as filtering and joining.

The information displayed by the `frontends_disks` tvf is authenticated, which is consistent with the behavior of `show frontends disks`, user must have ADMIN/OPERATOR privelege.
