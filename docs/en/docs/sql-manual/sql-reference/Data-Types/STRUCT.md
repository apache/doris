## STRUCT

### name

<version since="2.0.0">

STRUCT

</version>

### description

`STRUCT<field_name:field_type [COMMENT 'comment_string'], ... >`

Represents value with structure described by multiple fields, which can be viewed as a collection of multiple columns.

Need to manually enable the support, it is disabled by default.
```
admin set frontend config("enable_struct_type" = "true");
```
It cannot be used as a Key column. Now STRUCT can only used in Duplicate Model Tables.

The names and number of Fields in a Struct is fixed and always Nullable, and a Field typically consists of the following parts.

- field_name: Identifier naming the field, non repeatable.
- field_type: A data type.
- COMMENT: An optional string describing the field. (currently not supported)

The currently supported types are:

```
BOOLEAN, TINYINT, SMALLINT, INT, BIGINT, LARGEINT, FLOAT, DOUBLE, DECIMAL, DECIMALV3, DATE,
DATEV2, DATETIME, DATETIMEV2, CHAR, VARCHAR, STRING
```

We have a todo list for future version:

```
TODO:支持嵌套 STRUCT 或其他的复杂类型
```

### example

Create table example:

```
mysql> CREATE TABLE `struct_test` (
  `id` int(11) NULL,
  `s_info` STRUCT<s_id:int(11), s_name:string, s_address:string> NULL
) ENGINE=OLAP
DUPLICATE KEY(`id`)
COMMENT 'OLAP'
DISTRIBUTED BY HASH(`id`) BUCKETS 1
PROPERTIES (
"replication_allocation" = "tag.location.default: 1",
"storage_format" = "V2",
"light_schema_change" = "true",
"disable_auto_compaction" = "false"
);
```

Insert data example:

```
INSERT INTO `struct_test` VALUES (1, {1, 'sn1', 'sa1'});
INSERT INTO `struct_test` VALUES (2, struct(2, 'sn2', 'sa2'));
INSERT INTO `struct_test` VALUES (3, named_struct('s_id', 3, 's_name', 'sn3', 's_address', 'sa3'));
```

Stream load:

test.csv：

```
1|{"s_id":1, "s_name":"sn1", "s_address":"sa1"}
2|{s_id:2, s_name:sn2, s_address:sa2}
3|{"s_address":"sa3", "s_name":"sn3", "s_id":3}
```

exmaple:

```
curl --location-trusted -u root -T test.csv  -H "label:test_label" http://host:port/api/test/struct_test/_stream_load
```

Select data example:

```
mysql> select * from struct_test;
+------+-------------------+
| id   | s_info            |
+------+-------------------+
|    1 | {1, 'sn1', 'sa1'} |
|    2 | {2, 'sn2', 'sa2'} |
|    3 | {3, 'sn3', 'sa3'} |
+------+-------------------+
