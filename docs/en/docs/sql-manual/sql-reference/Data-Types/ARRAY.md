### example

Create table example:

```
mysql> CREATE TABLE `array_test` (
  `id` int(11) NULL COMMENT "",
  `c_array` ARRAY<int(11)> NULL COMMENT ""
) ENGINE=OLAP
DUPLICATE KEY(`id`)
COMMENT "OLAP"
DISTRIBUTED BY HASH(`id`) BUCKETS 1
PROPERTIES (
"replication_allocation" = "tag.location.default: 1",
"in_memory" = "false",
"storage_format" = "V2"
);
```

Insert data example:

```
mysql> INSERT INTO `array_test` VALUES (1, [1,2,3,4,5]);
mysql> INSERT INTO `array_test` VALUES (2, [6,7,8]), (3, []), (4, null);
```

Select data example:

```
mysql> SELECT * FROM `array_test`;
+------+-----------------+
| id   | c_array         |
+------+-----------------+
|    1 | [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] |
|    2 | [6, 7, 8]       |
