# BE Configuration

This document mainly introduces the relevant configuration items of BE.

The BE configuration file `be.conf` is usually stored in the `conf/` directory of the BE deployment path. In version 0.14, another configuration file `be_custom.conf` will be introduced. The configuration file is used to record the configuration items that are dynamically configured and persisted by the user during operation.

After the BE process is started, it will read the configuration items in `be.conf` first, and then read the configuration items in `be_custom.conf`. The configuration items in `be_custom.conf` will overwrite the same configuration items in `be.conf`.

The location of the `be_custom.conf` file can be configured in `be.conf` through the `custom_config_dir` configuration item.

## View configuration items

Users can view the current configuration items by visiting BE's web page:

`http://be_host:be_webserver_port/varz`

## Set configuration items

There are two ways to configure BE configuration items:

1. Static configuration

   Add and set configuration items in the `conf/be.conf` file. The configuration items in `be.conf` will be read when BE starts. Configuration items not in `be.conf` will use default values.

2. Dynamic configuration

   After BE starts, the configuration items can be dynamically set with the following commands.

    ```
    curl -X POST http://{be_ip}:{be_http_port}/api/update_config?{key}={value}'
    ```

   In version 0.13 and before, the configuration items modified in this way will become invalid after the BE process restarts. In 0.14 and later versions, the modified configuration can be persisted through the following command. The modified configuration items are stored in the `be_custom.conf` file.

    ```
    curl -X POST http://{be_ip}:{be_http_port}/api/update_config?{key}={value}&persis=true
    ```

## Examples

1. Modify `max_base_compaction_threads` statically

   By adding in the `be.conf` file:

   ```max_base_compaction_threads=5```

   Then restart the BE process to take effect the configuration.

2. Modify `streaming_load_max_mb` dynamically

   After BE starts, the configuration item `streaming_load_max_mb` is dynamically set by the following command:

    ```
    curl -X POST http://{be_ip}:{be_http_port}/api/update_config?streaming_load_max_mb=1024
    ```

   The return value is as follows, indicating that the setting is successful.

    ```
    {
        "status": "OK",
        "msg": ""
    }
    ```

   The configuration will become invalid after the BE restarts. If you want to persist the modified results, use the following command:

    ```
    curl -X POST http://{be_ip}:{be_http_port}/api/update_config?streaming_load_max_mb=1024\&persist=true
    ```

* Default value: 80%

#### `cluster_id`

* Type: int32
* Description: Configure the cluster id to which the BE belongs.
    - This value is usually delivered by the FE to the BE by the heartbeat, no need to configure. When it is confirmed that a BE belongs to a certain Drois cluster, it can be configured. The cluster_id file under the data directory needs to be modified to make sure same as this parament.
* Default value: - 1

#### `custom_config_dir`

* Description: Configure the location of the `be_custom.conf` file. The default is in the `conf/` directory.
    - In some deployment environments, the `conf/` directory may be overwritten due to system upgrades. This will cause the user modified configuration items to be overwritten. At this time, we can store `be_custom.conf` in another specified directory to prevent the configuration file from being overwritten.

At this time, you can avoid this error by increasing the configuration.

#### `brpc_socket_max_unwritten_bytes`

* Description: This configuration is mainly used to modify the parameter `socket_max_unwritten_bytes` of brpc.
  - Sometimes the query fails and an error message of `The server is overcrowded` will appear in the BE log.

#### `transfer_large_data_by_brpc`

* Type: bool
* Description: This configuration is used to control whether to serialize the protoBuf request and embed the Tuple/Block data into the controller attachment and send it through http brpc when the length of the Tuple/Block data is greater than 1.8G. To avoid errors when the length of the protoBuf request exceeds 2G: Bad request, error_text=[E1003]Fail to compress request. In the past version, after putting Tuple/Block data in the attachment, it was sent through the default baidu_std brpc, but when the attachment exceeds 2G, it will be truncated.

If the filter rate of the filter condition is lower than this configuration, Doris will stop using the dynamic partition clipping condition for data filtering.
* Default value: 90

#### `doris_max_scan_key_num`

* Type: int
* Description: Used to limit the maximum number of scan keys that a scan node can split in a query request. When a conditional query request reaches the scan node, the scan node will try to split the conditions related to the key column in the query condition into multiple scan key ranges. After that, these scan key ranges will be assigned to multiple scanner threads for data scanning. A larger value usually means that more scanner threads can be used to increase the parallelism of the scanning operation. However, in high concurrency scenarios, too many threads may bring greater scheduling overhead and system load, and will slow down the query response speed. An empirical value is 50. This configuration can be configured separately at the session level. For details, please refer to the description of `max_scan_key_num` in [Variables](../../../advanced/variables).
  - When the concurrency cannot be improved in high concurrency scenarios, try to reduce this value and observe the impact.

#### `doris_scanner_row_num`

* Description: The maximum number of data rows returned by each scanning thread in a single execution
* Default value: 16384

#### `doris_scanner_thread_pool_queue_size`

* Type: int32
* Description: The queue length of the Scanner thread pool. In Doris' scanning tasks, each Scanner will be submitted as a thread task to the thread pool waiting to be scheduled, and after the number of submitted tasks exceeds the length of the thread pool queue, subsequent submitted tasks will be blocked until there is a empty slot in the queue.
* Default value: 102400

#### `doris_scanner_thread_pool_thread_num`

* Type: int32
* Description: The number of threads in the Scanner thread pool. In Doris' scanning tasks, each Scanner will be submitted as a thread task to the thread pool to be scheduled. This parameter determines the size of the Scanner thread pool.

* Default value: 10485760

#### `max_pushdown_conditions_per_column`

* Type: int
* Description: Used to limit the maximum number of conditions that can be pushed down to the storage engine for a single column in a query request. During the execution of the query plan, the filter conditions on some columns can be pushed down to the storage engine, so that the index information in the storage engine can be used for data filtering, reducing the amount of data that needs to be scanned by the query. Such as equivalent conditions, conditions in IN predicates, etc. In most cases, this parameter only affects queries containing IN predicates. Such as `WHERE colA IN (1,2,3,4, ...)`. A larger number means that more conditions in the IN predicate can be pushed to the storage engine, but too many conditions may cause an increase in random reads, and in some cases may reduce query efficiency. This configuration can be individually configured for session level. For details, please refer to the description of `max_pushdown_conditions_per_column` in [Variables](../../advanced/variables.md).
