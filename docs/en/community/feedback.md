# Feedback

## Feedback Tips

- Describe the problem in detail, providing important details (logs, critical errors, investigations/analyses that have been performed)
- Minimize the problem, analyze the problem by yourself - narrow the scope of the problem, easy to answer / troubleshoot
- Give the minimization specific reproduction steps
- focus on the problem itself, as unrelated to the business/scenario as possible (if necessary, provide as clear and unambiguous context as possible)
