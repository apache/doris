## Prepare

### 0. Requirements

1. apache account ID
2. apache password
3. gpg key

### 1. Prepare the local maven environment

1. Generate the master password: `mvn --encrypt-master-password <password>` This password is only used to encrypt other subsequent passwords, and the output is similar to `{VSb+6+76djkH/43...}` and then create` ~/.m2/settings-security.xml` file, the content is

   ```
   <settingsSecurity>
     <master>{VSb+6+76djkH/43...}</master>
   </settingsSecurity>
   ```

2. Encrypt apache password: `mvn --encrypt-password <password>` This password is the password of the apache account. The output is similar to the above `{GRKbCylpwysHfV...}` and added in `~/.m2/settings.xml`
   ```
     <servers>
       <!-- To publish a snapshot of your project -->
       <server>
         <id>apache.snapshots.https</id>
         <username>yangzhg</username>
         <password>{GRKbCylpwysHfV...}</password>
       </server>
       <!-- To stage a release of your project -->
       <server>
         <id>apache.releases.https</id>
         <username>yangzhg</username>
         <password>{GRKbCylpwysHfV...}</password>
       </server>
     </servers>
   ```

3. Optional, (you can also pass -Darguments="-Dgpg.passphrase=xxxx" during deployment), add the following content in `~/.m2/settings.xml`, if the profiles tag already exists, this is only required Just add profile to profiles, activeProfiles is the same as above, xxxx is the passphrase of the gpg key
   ```
     <profiles>
       <profile>
         <id>gpg</id>
         <properties>
           <gpg.executable>gpg</gpg.executable>
           <gpg.passphrase>xxxx</gpg.passphrase>
         </properties>
       </profile>
     </profiles>
     <activeProfiles>
       <activeProfile>gpg</activeProfile>
     </activeProfiles>
   ```
## Publish to SNAPSHOT
### 1. Deploy flink connector

Switch to the flink connector directory, let’s take flink version 1.11.6 and scalar 2.12 as examples

   ```
   cd incubator-doris/extension/flink-doris-connector
   export DORIS_HOME=$PWD/../../
   source ${DORIS_HOME}/env.sh
   if [ -f ${DORIS_HOME}/custom_env.sh ]; then source ${DORIS_HOME}/custom_env.sh; fi
   export FLINK_VERSION="1.11.6"
   export SCALA_VERSION="2.12"
   mvn deploy
   ```



### 2. Deploy Spark connector

Switch to the spark connector directory, let’s take spark version 2.3.4 and scalar 2.11 as examples

   ```
   cd incubator-doris/extension/spark-doris-connector
   export DORIS_HOME=$PWD/../../
   source ${DORIS_HOME}/env.sh
   if [ -f ${DORIS_HOME}/custom_env.sh ]; then source ${DORIS_HOME}/custom_env.sh; fi
   export SPARK_VERSION="2.3.4"
   export SCALA_VERSION="2.11"
   mvn deploy
   ```
## Publish to Release

### 1. Prepare GitHub authority
Encrypt github token password: `mvn --encrypt-password <token>` This token is a token generated by github users to access the apache warehouse. The output cat is similar to `{bSSA+TC6wzEHNKukcOn...}` in `~/.m2/settings. Add to the `<servers>` tag in xml`
```xml
    <server>
      <id>github</id>
      <username>github user name</username>
      <password>{bSSA+TC6wzEHNKukcOn...}</password>
    </server>
```

### 2. Publish to  maven staging
Take the release of Doris Flink Connector 1.0.0 as an example, the flink version is 1.13.5, the scala version is 2.12, and others are similar
```bash
cd extension/flink-doris-connector/
export DORIS_HOME=$PWD/../../
source ${DORIS_HOME}/env.sh
export FLINK_VERSION=1.13.5
export SCALA_VERSION=2.12
mvn release:clean
mvn release:prepare
```
After that, maven needs to enter three information
1. The version information of Doris Flink Connector, we can do it by default, you can directly press Enter or enter the version you want
2. The release tag of Doris Flink Connector, because the release process will add a tag in apache/incubator-doris, so a tag name is required. If it is default, just press Enter.
3. The version number of the next version of Doris Flink Connector. Here we need to pay attention. Since our version number is {flink_version}_{scala_version}_1.0.0, maven's algorithm will increase the scala version number by one, if we want to use it next time This version of 1.0.1 can be changed to 1.13.5-2.12-1.0.1-SNAPSHOT
