# How To Be A Committer

In an Apache project, developers have three roles:

1. Contributor: When the developer's code is officially merged into the code, the developer automatically becomes the project's Contributor.
2. Committer: Committer has permission to merge into the code base. Committers are generally elected by the PMC (Project Management Committee).
3. PMC Member: a member of the project management committee. Have the right to vote on project decisions (such as version releases, etc.). It is generally elected by the PMC (Project Management Committee) through voting.

Different roles have different rights and obligations. There are no strict conditions on how to become a Committer or PMC Member, you can refer to here for more information:
