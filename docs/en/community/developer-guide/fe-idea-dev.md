# Setting Up Development Environment for FE using IntelliJ IDEA

## 1. Environmental Preparation

* Git
* JDK1.8+
* IntelliJ IDEA
* Maven (Optional, IDEA shipped embedded Maven3)

1. Git clone codebase from https://github.com/apache/doris.git


2. Use IntelliJ IDEA to open the code root directory

3. If you only develop fe without compiling thirdparty, you need to install thrift, and copy or connect thrift to the `thirdparty/installed/bin` directory

    Install `thrift 0.16.0` (Note: `Doris` 0.15 - 1.2 builds on `thrift 0.13.0`, the latest code is built using `thrift 0.16.0`)

    **The following examples use 0.16.0 as an example. If you need 0.13.0, please change 0.16.0 in the example below to 0.13.0. **
    
    - Windows: 

        1. Download: `http://archive.apache.org/dist/thrift/0.16.0/thrift-0.16.0.exe`
        2. Copy: Copy the file to `./thirdparty/installed/bin`
    
    - MacOS: 

        1. `brew tap-new $USER/local-tap`
        2. `brew extract --version='0.16.0' thrift $USER/local-tap`
        3. `brew install thrift@0.16.0`

        If there is an error related to downloading, you can modify the following files:

        `/usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Taps/$USER/homebrew-local-tap/Formula/thrift\@0.16.0.rb`

        Modify:

        `url "https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua?path=thrift/0.16.0/thrift-0.16.0.tar.gz"`

        To:

        `url "https://archive.apache.org/dist/thrift/0.16.0/thrift-0.16.0.tar.gz"`

        Reference: `https://gist.github.com/tonydeng/02e571f273d6cce4230dc8d5f394493c`
    
    - Linux:

        1. Download source: `wget https://archive.apache.org/dist/thrift/0.16.0/thrift-0.16.0.tar.gz`
        2. Install dependencies: `yum install -y autoconf automake libtool cmake ncurses-devel openssl-devel lzo-devel zlib-devel gcc gcc-c++`
        3. `tar zxvf thrift-0.16.0.tar.gz`
        4. `cd thrift-0.16.0`
        5. `./configure --without-tests`
        6. `make`
        7. `make install`

        Validate thrift version: `thrift --version`  

        > Note: If you have compiled Doris, you do not need to install thrift, you can directly use $DORIS_HOME/thirdparty/installed/bin/thrift

4. If it is a Mac or Linux environment, the code can be automatically generated by the following command:

    ```
    sh generated-source.sh
    ```

    If version before 1.2, using:
    
    ```
    cd fe
    mvn generate-sources
    ```

    Or:

    ```
    cd fe && mvn clean install -DskipTests
    ```

Or run the maven command through the graphical interface to generate:

![](/images/gen_code.png)

If you are developing on the OS which lack of support to run `shell script` and `make` such as Windows, a workround here 
is generate codes in Linux and copy them back. Using Docker should also be an option.

5. If a help document has not been generated, go to the docs directory and run`sh build_help_zip.sh`，

   Then copy help-resource.zip from build to fe/fe-core/target/classes

## 2. Debug

1. Import `./fe` into IDEA

2. Follow the picture to create the folders (The directory may exist in the new version. If it exists, skip it, otherwise create it.)

![](/images/DEBUG4.png)

3. Build `ui` project , and copy files from directory `ui/dist` into directory `webroot` ( you can skip this step , if you don't need `Doris` UI )

## 3. Custom FE configuration

Copy below content into `conf/fe.conf` and tune it to fit your environment(Note: If developed using`Mac`, since`docker for Mac`does not support`Host`mode,`be`needs to be exposed using`-p` and `fe.conf` `priority_networks` configured to be accessible within the container, such as WIFI Ip).

## 4. Setting Environment Variables

Follow the picture to set runtime Environment Variables in IDEA

## 5. Config options

Because part of the dependency is `provided`, idea needs to do a special config. Click on the right `Modify Options` in the `Run/Debug Configurations` setting. Check the `Add Dependencies with "Provided" scope to classpath` option.

## 6. Start FE

Having fun with Doris FE!
