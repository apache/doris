## Install environment dependency

```shell
brew install automake autoconf libtool pkg-config texinfo coreutils gnu-getopt \
python@3 cmake ninja ccache bison byacc gettext wget pcre maven llvm@16 openjdk@11 npm
```

*The version of jdk installed using brew is 11, because on macOS, the arm64 version of brew does not have version 8 of jdk by default*

**Dependency description:**
1. Java, Maven, etc. can be downloaded separately for easy management
    - Mac recommend [Zulu JDK8](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?version=java-8-lts&os=macos&package=jdk#zulu)
    - Maven Download from [Maven website](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) is ok
            - Self-downloaded Java and Maven need to configure environment variables
2. Other dependent environment variables (example for Apple Silicon Macs)
    - llvm: `export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin:$PATH"`
    - bison: `export PATH = "/opt/homebrew/opt/bison/bin:$PATH`
    - texinfo: `export PATH = "/opt/homebrew/opt/texinfo/bin:$PATH`
    - python: `ln -s -f /opt/homebrew/bin/python3 /opt/homebrew/bin/python`
   
## Install thrift

**Note：** Thrift needs to be installed only when debugging FE only. When debugging BE and FE at the same time, the three-party library of BE contains thrift

```shell
MacOS: 
    1. Download：`brew install thrift@0.16.0`
    2. Create a soft link： 
        `mkdir -p ./thirdparty/installed/bin`
        # Apple Silicon CPU macOS
        `ln -s /opt/homebrew/Cellar/thrift@0.16.0/0.16.0/bin/thrift ./thirdparty/installed/bin/thrift`
        # Intel CPU macOS
        `ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/thrift@0.16.0/0.16.0/bin/thrift ./thirdparty/installed/bin/thrift`
    
Note：macOS implement `brew install thrift@0.16.0` it may report an error that the version cannot be found. The solution is as follows, execute in the terminal:
    1. `brew tap-new $USER/local-tap`
    2. `brew extract --version='0.16.0' thrift $USER/local-tap`
    3. `brew install thrift@0.16.0`

```

## pull your own code

1. pull code

    ```shell
    cd ~
    mkdir DorisDev
    cd DorisDev
    git clone https://github.com/GitHubID/doris.git
    ```

2. set environment variables
 
    ```shell
    export DORIS_HOME=~/DorisDev/doris
    export PATH=$DORIS_HOME/bin:$PATH
    ```

## Download Doris compilation dependencies

1. The [Apache Doris Third Party Prebuilt](https://github.com/apache/doris-thirdparty/releases/tag/automation) page contains the source code of all third-party libraries. You can download [doris-thirdparty-source.tgz](https://github.com/apache/doris-thirdparty/releases/download/automation/doris-thirdparty-source.tgz) to obtain them.

2. You can download the _**precompiled**_ third party library from the [Apache Doris Third Party Prebuilt](https://github.com/apache/doris-thirdparty/releases/tag/automation) page. You may refer to the following commands:
    ```shell
    cd thirdparty
    rm -rf installed

    # Intel chips
    curl -L https://github.com/apache/doris-thirdparty/releases/download/automation/doris-thirdparty-prebuilt-darwin-x86_64.tar.xz \
        -o - | tar -Jxf -

    # Apple Silicon chips
    curl -L https://github.com/apache/doris-thirdparty/releases/download/automation/doris-thirdparty-prebuilt-darwin-arm64.tar.xz \
        -o - | tar -Jxf -

    # Make sure that protoc and thrift can run successfully.
    cd installed/bin

    ./protoc --version
    ./thrift --version
    ```
3. When running `protoc` or `thrift`, you may meet an error which says **the app can not be opened because the developer cannot be verified**. Go to `Security & Privacy`. Click the `Open Anyway` button in the `General` pane to confirm your intent to open the app. See [https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491).

## Set `file descriptors`

```shell
# bash
echo 'ulimit -n 65536' >>~/.bashrc
    
# zsh
echo 'ulimit -n 65536' >>~/.zshrc
```

## compile Doris

```shell
cd $DORIS_HOME
sh build.sh
```

## Configure Debug environment

```shell
# cp out the compiled package
    
cp -r output ../doris-run
    
# Configure FE/BE's conf
1、IP、directory
2、BE additional configuration min_file_descriptor_number = 10000
```

## Start Debugging with IDE

[CLion Debug BE On Mac](./be-clion-dev.md)

[IntelliJ IDEA Debug FE On Mac](./fe-idea-dev.md)
