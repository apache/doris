## unhex
### description
#### Syntax

`VARCHAR unhex(VARCHAR str)`

Enter a string, if the length of the string is 0 or an odd number, an empty string is returned;
If the string contains characters other than `[0-9], [a-z], [A-Z]`, an empty string is returned;
In other cases, every two characters are a group of characters converted into hexadecimal, and then spliced into a string for output.
