## group_concat
### description
#### Syntax

`VARCHAR GROUP_CONCAT(VARCHAR str[, VARCHAR sep])`


This function is an aggregation function similar to sum (), and group_concat links multiple rows of results in the result set to a string. The second parameter, sep, is a connection symbol between strings, which can be omitted. This function usually needs to be used with group by statements.
