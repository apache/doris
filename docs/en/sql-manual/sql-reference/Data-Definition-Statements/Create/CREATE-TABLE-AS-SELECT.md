## CREATE-TABLE-AS-SELECT

### Name

CREATE TABLE AS SELECT

### Description

This statement creates the table structure by returning the results from the Select statement and imports the data at the same time

grammarï¼š

```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name [( column_name_list )]
opt_engine opt_partition opt_properties KW_AS query_stmt
 ```

illustrate: 

- Fields of type`decimal`are not currently supported
- The user needs to have`SELECT`permission for the source table and`CREATE`permission for the target database
- After a table is created, data is imported. If the import fails, the table is deleted

### Example

1. Using the field names in the SELECT statement

    ```sql
    create table `test`.`select_varchar` 
    PROPERTIES(\"replication_num\" = \"1\") 
    as select * from `test`.`varchar_table`
    ```

2. Custom field names (need to match the number of fields returned)
    ```sql
    create table `test`.`select_name`(user, testname, userstatus) 
    PROPERTIES(\"replication_num\" = \"1\") 
    as select vt.userId, vt.username, jt.status 
    from `test`.`varchar_table` vt join 
    `test`.`join_table` jt on vt.userId=jt.userId
    ```
