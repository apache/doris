# Apache Doris Be development and debugging in VS Code

Some developers are building FE development environment on a development machine/WSL/docker, but this kind of development environment is not supported for local development, some developers are used to use VSCode to configure remote develop and debug.

## Preparation

* JDK11+ (Java Extension Pack need JDK11+) (author is creating a `lib` directory under `home`, and install [JDK11](https://github.com/adoptium/temurin11-binaries/releases/) and JDK8 in it, and use them for `Extensions` and `Compilation`)
* VSCode
  + Extension Pack for Java
  + Remote Extensions

## Download code for compilation

1. https://github.com/apache/incubator-doris.git Download the doris source code

2. use VSCode to open the code `/fe` directory

## Setting for VSCode

Create `settings.json` in `.vscode/` , and set settings:

* `"java.configuration.runtimes"`
* `"java.jdt.ls.java.home"` -- must set it to the directory of JDK11+, used for vscode-java plugin
* `"maven.executable.path"` -- maven pathï¼Œfor maven-language-server plugin

example:

```json
{
    "java.configuration.runtimes": [
        {
            "name": "JavaSE-1.8",
            "path": "/!!!path!!!/jdk-1.8.0_191"
        },
        {
            "name": "JavaSE-11",
            "path": "/!!!path!!!/jdk-11.0.14.1+1",
            "default": true
        },
    ],
    "java.jdt.ls.java.home": "/!!!path!!!/jdk-11.0.14.1+1",
    "maven.executable.path": "/!!!path!!!/maven/bin/mvn"
}
```

## Build

Other articles have already explained:
* [Build with LDB toolchain ](../install/source-install/compilation-with-ldb-toolchain.md)
* ......

In order to debug, you need to add debugging parameters when fe starts, such as `-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=5005` .

In `incubator-doris/output/fe/bin/start_fe.sh` , after `$JAVA $final_java_opt` add this param.
