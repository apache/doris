# C++ code formatting

Doris uses clang-format for code formatting, and provides a package script in the build-support directory:

* `clang-format.sh`.

    Format the C/C++ code in the `be/src` and `be/test` directories.

* `check-format.sh`.

    Check the C/C++ code format in the `be/src` and `be/test` directories, and output diff, but the content of the file will not be modified.

## Code style customization

The code style of Doris is slightly modified on the basis of Google Style and is customized as a `.clang-format` file located in the root directory of Doris.

Currently, the `.clang-format` configuration file is adapted to versions above clang-format-8.0.1.

The code that you do not want to be formatted is recorded in the `.clang-format-ignore` file. These codes usually come from third-party code bases, and it is recommended to keep the original code style.

## Environmental preparation

You need to download and install clang-format, or you can use the clang-format plug-in provided by IDE or Editor, as described below.

### Download and install clang-format

It is recommended to use NPM to install clang-format 11 (different versions of clang-format may produce different code formats, it is recommended to use version 11):

`npm install clang-format@1.4.0`

Ubuntu: `apt-get install clang-format`

The current version is 10.0, you can also specify the old version, for example: `apt-get install clang-format-9`

Mac: `brew install clang-format`

Centos 7:

The version of clang-format installed by centos yum is too old and supports too few StyleOptions. It is recommended to compile version 10.0 from source code.

### clang-format plugin

Clion IDE can use the plug-in "ClangFormat", search and download in `File->Setting->Plugins`. But the version canâ€™t match
The version of the clang-format program matches, judging from the supported StyleOption, it should be lower than clang-format-9.0.

## How to use

### Command line operation

cd to the root directory of Doris, and then execute the following command:

`build-support/clang-format.sh`

> Note: The `clang-format.sh` script requires python 3 to be installed on your machine

### Use clang-format in IDE or Editor

#### Clion

If Clion uses a plug-in, just click `Reformat Code`.

#### VS Code

VS Code needs to install the extension Clang-Format, but you need to provide the location of the clang-format execution program.

Open the VS Code configuration page, directly search for "clang_format", and fill in

```
"clang_format_path": "$clang-format path$",
"clang_format_style": "file"
```

Then, right-click on `Format Document`.
