## Environment preparation

- Install Docker
- VSCode
    - Remote plugin

## Build image

create dockerfile

VSCode replace all by using Ctrl-d

- <!!! your user !!!>
- <!!! your user password !!!>
- <!!! root password !!!>
- <!!! your git email !!!>
- <!!! your git username !!!>

```dockerfile
FROM apache/incubator-doris:build-env-latest

USER root
WORKDIR /root
RUN echo '<!!! root password !!!>' | passwd root --stdin

RUN yum install -y vim net-tools man wget git mysql lsof bash-completion \
        && cp /var/local/thirdparty/installed/bin/thrift /usr/bin

# safer usage, create new user instead of using root
RUN yum install -y sudo \
        && useradd -ms /bin/bash <!!! your user !!!> && echo <!!! your user password !!!> | passwd <!!! your user !!!> --stdin \
        && usermod -a -G wheel <!!! your user !!!>

USER <!!! your user !!!>
WORKDIR /home/<!!! your user !!!>
RUN git config --global color.ui true \
        && git config --global user.email "<!!! your git email !!!>" \
        && git config --global user.name "<!!! your git username !!!>"

# install zsh and oh my zsh, easier to use on, you can remove it if you don't need it
USER root
RUN yum install -y zsh \
        && chsh -s /bin/zsh <!!! your user !!!>
USER <!!! your user !!!>
RUN wget https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/raw/master/tools/install.sh -O - | zsh \
        && git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions \
        && git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting
```

run build command

```bash
docker build -t doris .
```

run image

note! [problems with mounting](../install/source-install/compilation.md)

> See the link above: It is recommended to run the image by mounting the local Doris source code directory as a volume .....

if you are developing on windows, mounting may cause cross-filesystem access problems, please consider setting it manually

```bash
docker run -it doris:latest /bin/bash
```

if you installed zsh, replace plugins in ~/.zshrc after running the container

```
plugins=(git zsh-autosuggestions zsh-syntax-highlighting)
```

create directory and download doris

```bash
su <your user>
mkdir code && cd code
git clone https://github.com/apache/incubator-doris.git
```

## Compile

Note:

use the following command first time compiling

```bash
sh build.sh --clean --be --fe --ui
```

it is because build-env-for-0.15.0 version image upgraded thrift(0.9 -> 0.13), so you need to use --clean command to force use new version of thrift to generate code files, otherwise it will cause incompatibilities.

compile Doris

```bash
sh build.sh
```

## Run

manually create `meta_dir` metadata storage location, default value is `${DORIS_HOME}/doris-meta`

```bash
mkdir meta_dir
```

launch FE

```bash
cd output/fe
sh bin/start_fe.sh --daemon
```

launch BE

```bash
cd output/be
sh bin/start_be.sh --daemon
```

mysql-client connect

```bash
mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 9030 -u root
```
