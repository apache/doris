# Setting Up Development Environment for FE using IntelliJ IDEA

## 1. Environmental Preparation

* Git
* JDK1.8+
* IntelliJ IDEA
* Maven (Optional, IDEA shipped embedded Maven3)

1. Git clone codebase from https://github.com/apache/incubator-doris.git


2. Use IntelliJ IDEA to open the code root directory


3. If your are only interested in FE module, and for some reason you can't or don't want to compile full thirdparty libraries,
   the minimum tool required for FE module is `thrift`, so you can manually install `thrift` and copy or create a link of
   the executable `thrift` command to `./thirdparty/installed/bin`.
   ```
   Doris build against `thrift` 0.13.0 ( note : `Doris` 0.15 and later version build against `thrift` 0.13.0 , the previous version is still `thrift` 0.9.3)   
   
   Windows: 
      1. Download：`http://archive.apache.org/dist/thrift/0.13.0/thrift-0.13.0.exe`
      2. Copy：copy the file to `./thirdparty/installed/bin`
      
   MacOS: 
      1. Download：`brew install thrift@0.13.0`
      2. Establish soft connection： 
        `mkdir -p ./thirdparty/installed/bin`
        # For ARM macOS
        `ln -s /opt/homebrew/Cellar/thrift@0.13.0/0.13.0/bin/thrift ./thirdparty/installed/bin/thrift`
        # For Intel macOS
        `ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/thrift@0.13.0/0.13.0/bin/thrift ./thirdparty/installed/bin/thrift`
      
   Note：The error that the version cannot be found may be reported when MacOS execute `brew install thrift@0.13.0`. The solution is execute at the terminal as follows:
      1. `brew tap-new $USER/local-tap`
      2. `brew extract --version='0.13.0' thrift $USER/local-tap`
      3. `brew install thrift@0.13.0`
   Reference link: `https://gist.github.com/tonydeng/02e571f273d6cce4230dc8d5f394493c`
   ```

4. Go to `./fe` folder and run the following maven command to generate sources.

   ```
   mvn generate-sources
   ```
   
   If fails, run following command.
   
   ```
   mvn clean install -DskipTests
   ```
   
   You can also use IDE embedded GUI tools to run maven command to generate sources

If you are developing on the OS which lack of support to run `shell script` and `make` such as Windows, a workround here 
is generate codes in Linux and copy them back. Using Docker should also be an option.

## 2. Debug

1. Import `./fe` into IDEA

2. Follow the picture to create the folders (The directory may exist in the new version. If it exists, skip it, otherwise create it.)

![](/images/DEBUG4.png)

3. Build `ui` project , and copy files from directory `ui/dist` into directory `webroot` ( you can skip this step , if you don't need `Doris` UI )

## 3. Custom FE configuration

Copy below content into `conf/fe.conf` and tune it to fit your environment(Note: If developed using`Mac`, since`docker for Mac`does not support`Host`mode,`be`needs to be exposed using`-p` and `fe.conf` `priority_networks` configured to be accessible within the container, such as WIFI Ip).
