# Format Code
Doris use `Clang-format` to automatically check the format of your source code.

## Code Style
Doris Code Style is based on Google's, makes a few changes. The customized .clang-format
file is in the root dir of Doris.
Now, .clang-format file only works on clang-format-8.0.1+.

## Preparing
You should install clang-format, or you can use clang-format plugins which support by IDEs or Editors.

### Install clang-format
Ubuntu: `apt-get install clang-format` 

Mac: `brew install clang-format`

The current release is 10.0, you can specify old version, e.g.
 
 `apt-get install clang-format-9`

Centos 7: 

The version of clang-format installed by yum is too old. Compiling clang from source
is recommended.

### Clang-format plugins
Clion IDE supports the plugin "ClangFormat", you can search in `File->Setting->Plugins`
 and download it.
But the version is not match with clang-format. Judging from the options supported, 
the version is lower than clang-format-9.0.

## Usage

### CMD
Change directory to the root directory of Doris sources and run the following command:
`build-support/clang-format.sh`

NOTE: Python3 is required to run the `clang-format.sh` script.

### Using clang-format in IDEs or Editors
#### Clion
If using the plugin 'ClangFormat' in Clion, choose `Reformat Code` or press the keyboard 
shortcut.

#### VS Code
VS Code needs install the extension 'Clang-Format', and specify the executable path of 
clang-format in settings.

Open the vs code configuration page and search `clang_format`, fill the box as follows.

```
"clang_format_path": "$clang-format path$",
"clang_format_style": "file"
```
Then, right click the file and choose `Format Document`.
