# User configuration item

This document mainly introduces related configuration items at the User level. The configuration of the User level is mainly effective for a single user. Each user can set their own User property. Does not affect each other.

## View configuration items

After the FE is started, on the MySQL client, use the following command to view the User configuration items:

`SHOW PROPERTY [FOR user] [LIKE key pattern]`

The specific syntax can be queried through the command: `help show property;`.

## Set configuration items

After FE is started, on the MySQL client, modify the User configuration items with the following command:

`SET PROPERTY [FOR'user'] 'key' = 'value' [,'key' ='value']`

The specific syntax can be queried through the command: `help set property;`.

User-level configuration items will only take effect for the specified users, and will not affect the configuration of other users.

## Application examples

1. Modify the max_user_connections of user Billie

    Use `SHOW PROPERTY FOR 'Billie' LIKE '%max_user_connections%';` to check that the current maximum number of links for Billie users is 100.

    Use `SET PROPERTY FOR 'Billie' 'max_user_connections' = '200';` to modify the current maximum number of connections for Billie users to 200.

## Configuration item list
