# SQL Block Rule

Support SQL block rule by user level, by regex way to deny specify SQL

## Rule

SQL block rule CRUD
- create SQL block rule
    - sql：Regex pattern，Special characters need to be translated
    - sqlHash: Sql hash value, Used to match exactly, We print it in fe.audit.log，This parameter is the only choice between sql and sql, If you give a null value, it is an empty string not null
    - global: Whether global(all users)is in effect, false by default
    - enable：Whether to enable block rule，true by default
```sql
CREATE SQL_BLOCK_RULE test_rule 
PROPERTIES(
  "sql"="select * from order_analysis",
  "global"="false",
  "enable"="true",
  "sqlHash"=""
)
```
When we execute the sql that we defined in the rule just now, an exception error will be returned. An example is as follows:
```sql
mysql> select * from order_analysis;
ERROR 1064 (HY000): errCode = 2, detailMessage = sql match regex sql block rule: order_analysis_rule
```
- show configured SQL block rules, or show all rules if you do not specify a rule name

```sql
SHOW SQL_BLOCK_RULE [FOR RULE_NAME]
```
- alter SQL block rule，Allows changes sql/global/enable anyone
```sql
ALTER SQL_BLOCK_RULE test_rule PROPERTIES("sql"="select \\* from test_table","enable"="true")
```
- drop SQL block rule，Support multiple rules, separated by `,`
```sql
DROP SQL_BLOCK_RULE test_rule1,test_rule2
```

## User bind rules
If global=false is configured, the rules binding for the specified user needs to be configured, with multiple rules separated by ', '
```sql
SET PROPERTY [FOR 'jack'] 'sql_block_rules' = 'test_rule1,test_rule2'
```
