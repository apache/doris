# Statistics of query execution

This document focuses on introducing the **Running Profile** which recorded runtime status of Doris in query execution. Using these statistical information, we can understand the execution of frgment to become a expert of Doris's **debugging and tuning**.

## Noun Interpretation

* **FE**: Frontend, frontend node of Doris. Responsible for metadata management and request access.

* **BE**: Backend, backend node of Doris. Responsible for query execution and data storage.

* **Fragment**: FE will convert the execution of specific SQL statements into corresponding fragments and distribute them to BE for execution. BE will execute corresponding fragments and gather the result of RunningProfile to send back FE.

## Basic concepts

FE splits the query plan into fragments and distributes them to BE for task execution. BE records the statistics of **Running State** when executing fragment. BE print the outputs statistics of fragment execution into the log. FE can also collect these statistics recorded by each fragment and print the results on FE's web page.
## Specific operation

Turn on the report switch on FE through MySQL command

```
mysql> set is_report_success=true; 
```

After executing the corresponding SQL statement, we can see the report information of the corresponding SQL statement on the FE web page like the picture below.
![image.png](/images/running_profile.png)

The latest  **100 statements** executed will be listed here. We can view detailed statistics of RunningProfile.
```
Query:
  Summary:
    Query ID: 9664061c57e84404-85ae111b8ba7e83a
    Start Time: 2020-05-02 10:34:57
    End Time: 2020-05-02 10:35:08
    Total: 10s323ms
    Query Type: Query
    Query State: EOF
    Doris Version: trunk

    Default Db: default_cluster:test
    Sql Statement: select max(Bid_Price) from quotes group by Symbol
```
Here is a detailed list of  ```query ID, execution time, execution statement``` and other summary information. The next step is to print the details of each fragment collected from be.
 ```
    Fragment 0:
      Instance 9664061c57e84404-85ae111b8ba7e83d (host=TNetworkAddress(hostname:192.168.0.1, port:9060)):(Active: 10s270ms, % non-child: 0.14%)
         - MemoryLimit: 2.00 GB
         - BytesReceived: 168.08 KB
         - PeakUsedReservation: 0.00 
         - SendersBlockedTimer: 0ns
         - DeserializeRowBatchTimer: 501.975us
         - PeakMemoryUsage: 577.04 KB
         - RowsProduced: 8.322K (8322)
        EXCHANGE_NODE (id=4):(Active: 10s256ms, % non-child: 99.35%)
           - ConvertRowBatchTime: 180.171us
           - PeakMemoryUsage: 0.00 
           - RowsReturned: 8.322K (8322)
           - MemoryUsed: 0.00 
           - RowsReturnedRate: 811
```
The fragment ID is listed here; ``` hostname ``` show the be node executing the fragment; ```active: 10s270ms```show the total execution time of the node;  ```non child: 0.14%``` means the execution time of the execution node itself (not including the execution time of child nodes) as a percentage of the total time. 

`PeakMemoryUsage` indicates the peak memory usage of `EXCHANGE_NODE`; `RowsReturned` indicates the number of rows returned by `EXCHANGE_NODE`; `RowsReturnedRate`=`RowsReturned`/`ActiveTime`; the meaning of these three statistics in other `NODE` the same.

Subsequently, the statistics of the child nodes will be printed in turn. **here you can distinguish the parent-child relationship by intent**.

#### `OLAP_SCAN_NODE`

The `OLAP_SCAN_NODE` is responsible for specific data scanning tasks. One `OLAP_SCAN_NODE` will generate one or more `OlapScanner`. Each Scanner thread is responsible for scanning part of the data.

Some or all of the predicate conditions in the query will be pushed to `OLAP_SCAN_NODE`. Some of these predicate conditions will continue to be pushed down to the storage engine in order to use the storage engine's index for data filtering. The other part will be kept in `OLAP_SCAN_NODE` to filter the data returned from the storage engine.

The profile of the `OLAP_SCAN_NODE` node is usually used to analyze the efficiency of data scanning. It is divided into three layers: `OLAP_SCAN_NODE`, `OlapScanner`, and `SegmentIterator` according to the calling relationship.

The profile of a typical `OLAP_SCAN_NODE` is as follows. Some indicators will have different meanings depending on the storage format (V1 or V2).

```

```

The predicate push down and index usage can be inferred from the related indicators of the number of data rows in the profile. The following only describes the profile in the reading process of segment V2 format data. In segment V1 format, the meaning of these indicators is slightly different.

  - When reading a segment V2, if the query has key_ranges (the query range composed of prefix keys), first filter the data through the SortkeyIndex index, and the number of filtered rows is recorded in `RowsKeyRangeFiltered`.
  - After that, use the Bitmap index to perform precise filtering on the columns containing the bitmap index in the query condition, and the number of filtered rows is recorded in `RowsBitmapIndexFiltered`.
  - After that, according to the equivalent (eq, in, is) condition in the query condition, use the BloomFilter index to filter the data and record it in `RowsBloomFilterFiltered`. The value of `RowsBloomFilterFiltered` is the difference between the total number of rows of the Segment (not the number of rows filtered by the Bitmap index) and the number of remaining rows after BloomFilter, so the data filtered by BloomFilter may overlap with the data filtered by Bitmap.
  - After that, use the ZoneMap index to filter the data according to the query conditions and delete conditions and record it in `RowsStatsFiltered`.
  - `RowsConditionsFiltered` is the number of rows filtered by various indexes, including the values â€‹â€‹of `RowsBloomFilterFiltered` and `RowsStatsFiltered`.
  - So far, the Init phase is completed, and the number of rows filtered by the condition to be deleted in the Next phase is recorded in `RowsDelFiltered`. Therefore, the number of rows actually filtered by the delete condition are recorded in `RowsStatsFiltered` and `RowsDelFiltered` respectively.
  - `RawRowsRead` is the final number of rows to be read after the above filtering.
  - `RowsRead` is the number of rows finally returned to Scanner. `RowsRead` is usually smaller than `RawRowsRead`, because returning from the storage engine to the Scanner may go through a data aggregation. If the difference between `RawRowsRead` and `RowsRead` is large, it means that a large number of rows are aggregated, and aggregation may be time-consuming.
  - `RowsReturned` is the number of rows finally returned by ScanNode to the upper node. `RowsReturned` is usually smaller than `RowsRead`. Because there will be some predicate conditions on the Scanner that are not pushed down to the storage engine, filtering will be performed once. If the difference between `RowsRead` and `RowsReturned` is large, it means that many rows are filtered in the Scanner. This shows that many highly selective predicate conditions are not pushed to the storage engine. The filtering efficiency in Scanner is worse than that in storage engine.

Through the above indicators, you can roughly analyze the number of rows processed by the storage engine and the size of the final filtered result row. Through the `Rows***Filtered` group of indicators, it is also possible to analyze whether the query conditions are pushed down to the storage engine, and the filtering effects of different indexes. In addition, a simple analysis can be made through the following aspects.
    
  - Many indicators under `OlapScanner`, such as `IOTimer`, `BlockFetchTime`, etc., are the accumulation of all Scanner thread indicators, so the value may be relatively large. And because the Scanner thread reads data asynchronously, these cumulative indicators can only reflect the cumulative working time of the Scanner, and do not directly represent the time consumption of the ScanNode. The time-consuming ratio of ScanNode in the entire query plan is the value recorded in the `Active` field. Sometimes it appears that `IOTimer` has tens of seconds, but `Active` is actually only a few seconds. This situation is usually due to:
    - `IOTimer` is the accumulated time of multiple Scanners, and there are more Scanners.
    - The upper node is time-consuming. For example, the upper node takes 100 seconds, while the lower ScanNode only takes 10 seconds. The field reflected in `Active` may be only a few milliseconds. Because while the upper layer is processing data, ScanNode has performed data scanning asynchronously and prepared the data. When the upper node obtains data from ScanNode, it can obtain the prepared data, so the Active time is very short.
  - `NumScanners` represents the number of Tasks submitted by the Scanner to the thread pool. It is scheduled by the thread pool in `RuntimeState`. The two parameters `doris_scanner_thread_pool_thread_num` and `doris_scanner_thread_pool_queue_size` control the size of the thread pool and the queue length respectively. Too many or too few threads will affect query efficiency. At the same time, some summary indicators can be divided by the number of threads to roughly estimate the time consumption of each thread.
  - `TabletCount` indicates the number of tablets to be scanned. Too many may mean a lot of random read and data merge operations.
  - `UncompressedBytesRead` indirectly reflects the amount of data read. If the value is large, it means that there may be a lot of IO operations.
  - `CachedPagesNum` and `TotalPagesNum` can check the hitting status of PageCache. The higher the hit rate, the less time-consuming IO and decompression operations.
