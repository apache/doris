# FE Metrics

This document mainly introduces the monitor metrics of FE.

## View Metrics

FE metrics can be viewed by visiting:

`http://fe_host:fe_http_port/metrics`

The default format is of [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/).

You can get Json format by visiting:

`http://fe_host:fe_http_port/metrics?type=json`

## Metrics List

### `doris_fe_snmp{name="tcp_in_errs"}`

Value of the `Tcp: InErrs` field in `/proc/net/snmp`. Represents the number of error TCP packets currently received.

The incidence rate can be calculated in combination with the sampling period.

Usually used to troubleshoot network problems.

### `doris_fe_snmp{name="tcp_retrans_segs"}`

Value of the `Tcp: RetransSegs` field in `/proc/net/snmp`. Represents the number of error TCP packets currently received.

The incidence rate can be calculated in combination with the sampling period.

Usually used to troubleshoot network problems.

### `doris_fe_snmp{name="tcp_in_segs"}`

Value of the `Tcp: InSegs` field in `/proc/net/snmp`. Represents the number of received TCP packets.

Use `(NEW_tcp_in_errs - OLD_tcp_in_errs) / (NEW_tcp_in_segs - OLD_tcp_in_segs)` can calculate the error rate of received TCP packets.

Usually used to troubleshoot network problems.

### `doris_fe_snmp{name="tcp_out_segs"}`

Value of the `Tcp: OutSegs` field in `/proc/net/snmp`. Represents the number of send TCP packets with RST mark.

Use `(NEW_tcp_retrans_segs - OLD_tcp_retrans_segs) / (NEW_tcp_out_segs - OLD_tcp_out_segs)` can calculate the retrans rate of TCP packets.

Usually used to troubleshoot network problems.

### `jvm_thread{type="count"}`

Value of the `count` type in `jvm_thread`. Represents the current number of live threads including both daemon and non-daemon threads.

Usually used to troubleshoot jvm threads problems for FE.

### `jvm_thread{type="peak_count"}`

Value of the `peak_count` type in `jvm_thread`. Represents the current number of live threads including both daemon and non-daemon threads.

Usually used to troubleshoot jvm threads problems for FE.

### `jvm_thread{type="new_count"}`

Value of the `new_count` type in `jvm_thread`. Represents the current number of threads which state is NEW.

Usually used to troubleshoot jvm threads problems for FE.

### `jvm_thread{type="runnable_count"}`

Value of the `runnable_count` type in `jvm_thread`. Represents the current number of threads which state is RUNNABLE.

Usually used to troubleshoot jvm threads problems for FE.

### `jvm_thread{type="blocked_count"}`

Value of the `blocked_count` type in `jvm_thread`. Represents the current number of threads which state is BLOCKED.

Usually used to troubleshoot jvm threads problems for FE.

### `jvm_thread{type="waiting_count"}`

Value of the `waiting_count` type in `jvm_thread`. Represents the current number of threads which state is WAITING.

Usually used to troubleshoot jvm threads problems for FE.

### `jvm_thread{type="timed_waiting_count"}`

Value of the `timed_waiting_count` type in `jvm_thread`. Represents the current number of threads which state is TIMED_WAITING.

Usually used to troubleshoot jvm threads problems for FE.

### `jvm_thread{type="terminated_count"}`

Value of the `terminated_count` type in `jvm_thread`. Represents the current number of threads which state is TERMINATED.

Usually used to troubleshoot jvm threads problems for FE.
