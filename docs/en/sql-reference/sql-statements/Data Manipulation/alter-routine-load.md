# ALTER ROUTINE LOAD
## description

This syntax is used to modify a routine import job that has been created.

Only jobs in the PAUSED state can be modified.

Syntax:

    ALTER ROUTINE LOAD FOR [db.]job_name
    [job_properties]
    FROM data_source
    [data_source_properties]

1. `[db.]job_name`

    Specify the name of the job to be modified.

2. `job_properties`

    Specify the job parameters that need to be modified. Currently only supports the modification of the following parameters:
    
    1. `desired_concurrent_number`
    2. `max_error_number`
    3. `max_batch_interval`
    4. `max_batch_rows`
    5. `max_batch_size`
    6. `jsonpaths`
    7. `json_root`
    8. `strip_outer_array`
    9. `strict_mode`
    10. `timezone`
    11. `num_as_string`
    12. `fuzzy_parse`


3. `data_source`

    The type of data source. Currently supported:

    KAFKA

4. `data_source_properties`

    The relevant attributes of the data source. Currently only supports:
    
    1. `kafka_partitions`
    2. `kafka_offsets`
    3. Custom property, such as `property.group.id`
    
    Notice：
    
    1. `kafka_partitions` and `kafka_offsets` are used to modify the offset of the kafka partition to be consumed, and can only modify the currently consumed partition. Cannot add partition.

## example

1. Modify `desired_concurrent_number` to 1

    ```
    ALTER ROUTINE LOAD FOR db1.label1
    PROPERTIES
    (
        "desired_concurrent_number" = "1"
    );
    ```

2.  Modify `desired_concurrent_number` to 10, modify partition offset, and modify group id。

    ```
    ALTER ROUTINE LOAD FOR db1.label1
    PROPERTIES
    (
        "desired_concurrent_number" = "10"
    )
    FROM kafka
    (
        "kafka_partitions" = "0, 1, 2",
        "kafka_offsets" = "100, 200, 100",
        "property.group.id" = "new_group"
    );
    ```
