# SHOW STREAM LOAD
## Description
This statement is used to show the execution of the specified import task
Grammar:
SHOW STREAM LOAD
[FROM both names]
[
WHERE
[LABEL [ = "your_label" | LIKE "label_matcher"]]
[STATUS = ["SUCCESS"|"FAIL"|]]
]
[ORDER BY ...]
[LIMIT limit][OFFSET offset];

Explain:
1) If db_name is not specified, use the current default DB
2) If you use LABEL LIKE, the label that matches the task contains the STREAM LOAD task of label_matcher
3) If LABEL = is used, the specified label is matched accurately.
4) If STATUS is specified, the STREAM LOAD status is matched
5) Arbitrary column combinations can be sorted using ORDER BY
6) If LIMIT is specified, the limit bar matching record is displayed. Otherwise, all of them will be displayed.
7) If OFFSET is specified, the query results are displayed from offset. By default, the offset is 0.

## example
1. Show all STREAM LOAD tasks of default DB
SHOW STREAM LOAD;

2. Show the STREAM LOAD task of the specified db. The label contains the string "2014_01_02", showing the oldest 10
SHOW STREAM LOAD FROM example_db WHERE LABEL LIKE "2014_01_02" LIMIT 10;

3. Show the STREAM LOAD task of the specified db, specify label as "load_example_db_20140102"
SHOW STREAM LOAD FROM example_db WHERE LABEL = "load_example_db_20140102";

4. Show the STREAM LOAD task of the specified db, specify status as "success", and sort it in descending order by LoadStartTime
SHOW STREAM LOAD FROM example_db WHERE STATUS = "success" ORDER BY LoadStartTime DESC;

5. Show the STREAM LOAD task of the specified dB and sort it in descending order by LoadStartTime, and display 10 query results starting with offset 5
SHOW STREAM LOAD FROM example_db ORDER BY LoadStartTime DESC limit 5,10;
SHOW STREAM LOAD FROM example_db ORDER BY LoadStartTime DESC limit 10 offset 5;
