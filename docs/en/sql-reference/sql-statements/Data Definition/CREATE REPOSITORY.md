# CREATE REPOSITORY
## Description
This statement is used to create the warehouse. The warehouse is used for backup or recovery. Only root or superuser users can create warehouses.
Grammar:
CREATE [READ ONLY] REPOSITORY `repo_name`
WITH BROKER `broker_name`
ON LOCATION `repo_location`
PROPERTIES ("key"="value", ...);

Explain:
1. The creation of warehouses depends on existing brokers
2. If it is a read-only warehouse, it can only be restored on the warehouse. If not, you can backup and restore operations.
3. According to the different types of broker, PROPERTIES is different, see the example.

## example
1. Create a warehouse named bos_repo, which relies on BOS broker "bos_broker", and the data root directory is: bos://palo_backup.
CREATE REPOSITORY `bos_repo`
WITH BROKER `bos_broker`
ON LOCATION "bos://palo_backup"
PROPERTIES
(
"bos_endpoint" ="http://gz.bcebos.com",
"bos_accesskey" = "069fc2786e664e63a5f111111114ddbs22",
"bos_secret_accesskey"="70999999999999de274d59eaa980a"
);

2. Create the same warehouse as in Example 1, but with read-only attributes:
CREATE READ ONLY REPOSITORY `bos_repo`
WITH BROKER `bos_broker`
ON LOCATION "bos://palo_backup"
PROPERTIES
(
"bos_endpoint" ="http://gz.bcebos.com",
"bos_accesskey" = "069fc2786e664e63a5f111111114ddbs22",
"bos_secret_accesskey"="70999999999999de274d59eaa980a"
);

3. Create a warehouse named hdfs_repo, which relies on Baidu HDFS broker "hdfs_broker", and the data root directory is: hdfs://hadoop-name-node:54310/path/to/repo./
CREATE REPOSITORY `hdfs_repo`
WITH BROKER `hdfs_broker`
ON LOCATION "hdfs://hadoop-name-node:54310/path/to/repo/"
PROPERTIES
(
"Username" = "User"
"password" = "password"
);
