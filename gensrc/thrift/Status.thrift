// NOTE: Each item of StatusCode is explicitly assigned a constant value.
// The TStatusCode struct is used in all FEs and BEs. In order to be able to
// avoid errors when identifying status_codes in RPC during upgrading Doris
// (update and restart the servers one by one), we must ensure that each element
// always a fixed value.
//
// If each element is not explicitly assigned a constant, then the value of
// each element will be assigned from 0 in turn, which will need us to be very
// careful when adding and removing elements, to avoid the same element on
// different machines to be recognized as a different value. i.e., new elements
// can only be added to the end, and only elements at the end can be deleted.
// Unfortunately, this implicit constraint is likely to be ignored by
// programmers when coding, especially those who are new to Doris.
//
// NOTE: We use one byte in doris::Status, so the max value is 255.
