# data root path, separate by ';'
# you can specify the storage medium of each root path, HDD or SSD
# you can add capacity limit at the end of each root path, seperate by ','
# eg:
# storage_root_path = /home/disk1/doris.HDD,50;/home/disk2/doris.SSD,1;/home/disk2/doris
# /home/disk1/doris.HDD, capacity limit is 50GB, HDD;

# /home/disk2/doris, capacity limit is disk capacity, HDD(default)

# you also can specify the properties by setting '<property>:<value>', seperate by ','
# property 'medium' has a higher priority than the extension of path

# Default value is ${DORIS_HOME}/storage, you should create it by hand.
