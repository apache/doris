## DataX Extension Directory

This directory is the doriswriter plug-in development environment of Alibaba DataX.

Because the doriswriter plug-in depends on some modules in the DataX code base, and these module dependencies are not submitted to the official Maven repository, when we develop the doriswriter plug-in, we need to download the complete DataX code base to facilitate our development and compilation of the doriswriter plug-in.

### Directory structure

1. `doriswriter/`

    This directory is the code directory of doriswriter, and this part of the code should be in the Doris code base.

    The help doc can be found in `doriswriter/doc`
    
2. `init_env.sh`

    The script mainly performs the following steps:
    
    1. Git clone the DataX code base to the local
    2. Softlink the `doriswriter/` directory to `DataX/doriswriter`.
    3. Add `<module>doriswriter</module>` to the original `DataX/pom.xml`
    4. Change httpclient version from 4.5 to 4.5.13 in DataX/core/pom.xml

        > httpclient v4.5 can not handle redirect 307 correctly. 
    
    After that, developers can enter `DataX/` for development. And the changes in the `DataX/doriswriter` directory will be reflected in the `doriswriter/` directory, which is convenient for developers to submit code.

### How to build

1. Run `init_env.sh`
2. Modify code of doriswriter in `DataX/doriswriter`
3. Build doriswriter
    
    1. Build doriswriter along:

        `mvn clean install -pl plugin-rdbms-util,doriswriter -DskipTests`

    2. Build DataX:

        `mvn package assembly:assembly -Dmaven.test.skip=true`

        The output will be in `target/datax/datax/`.

        > hdfsreader, hdfswriter and oscarwriter needs some extra jar packages. If you don't need to use these components, you can comment out the corresponding module in DataX/pom.xml.
    
4. Commit code of doriswriter in `doriswriter`
