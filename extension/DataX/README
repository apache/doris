## DataX Extension Directory

This directory is the doriswriter plug-in development environment of Alibaba DataX.

Because the doriswriter plug-in depends on some modules in the DataX code base, and these module dependencies are not submitted to the official Maven repository, when we develop the doriswriter plug-in, we need to download the complete DataX code base to facilitate our development and compilation of the doriswriter plug-in.

### Directory structure

1. `doriswriter/`

     This directory is the code directory of doriswriter, and this part of the code should be in the Doris code base.
    
2. `init_env.sh`

     The script mainly performs the following steps:
    
     1. Git clone the DataX code base to the local
     2. Softlink the `doriswriter/` directory to `DataX/doriswriter`.
     3. Add `<module>doriswriter</module>` to the original `DataX/pom.xml`
    
     After that, developers can enter `DataX/` for development. And the changes in the `DataX/doriswriter` directory will be reflected in the `doriswriter/` directory, which is convenient for developers to submit code.

### How to build

1. Run `init_env.sh`
2. Modify code of doriswriter in `DataX/doriswriter`
3. Commit code of doriswriter in `doriswriter`
